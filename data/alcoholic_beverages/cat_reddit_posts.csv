As I've got older, I've realised that a lot of these perks can be enjoyed without consuming overpriced posionous liquid. 

I made the decision a while back to cut out alcohol all together and I've found the following benefits

1. I can always drive if needed
2. Soft drinks are cheaper and normally healthier.
3. Weight is easier to manage.
4. Going out costs less. Not only the cost in drinks, but also taxis
5. I forgot how a hangover feels
6. My skin is better
7. I remember nights out more
8. Inhibitions exist for a reason. I can control if I choose to loosen them
9. The peace of mind that comes from not regularly introducing an addictive substance into your body. 
10. Zero chance of things getting out of hand and me waking up with regrets. 

Those are 10 benefits I've found from quitting. I had to narrow them down as I can think of many more, but 10s a nice round number. I'm really struggling to find a single benefit to be found by reintroducing alcohol to my life. 

Sobriety has many benefits. Consuming even modest amounts of alcohol doesn't appear to have any.


Edit: there seems to be a lot of comments talking about how it's only binge drinking that's negative and that drinking in moderation is fine, which is an ok opinion.

Let's even put aside the crazy amount of calories in alcoholic beverages. 

When you're drinking, you're often drinking at night (close to bed time). Consuming anything right before bed isn't going to help. 

When you're drinking you want those drinking snacks (love a good burger when I'm drunk). Also not helpful. 

For those of us on the 30+ side of things, hangovers get real. When I'm hungover, I deny myself nothing. 

Then I skip my workout because I'm too hungover. 

This is my personal experience. If you can maintain and work through this stuff, props, I'm jealous. I know however, that they'll still sell me alcohol after I meet my goals. It'll still be there when I'm ready for it. My friends that drink will still drink with me when I've met my goals. 

We're all here because we have the same goal. For me, making my life as easy as possible in meeting these goals makes sense. 

So, if you were waiting for the sign to take a break, here it is. Cheers to looking good with a drink in your hand this summer!

Edit: Well, definitely didn't expect this to blow up. Figured there were a few recurring themes to address as far as replies.

Eating before bed: hey, I learned something new, and it's not the bad thing I was told it was previously! Still, for me, I feel better not going to sleep bloated and I like eating early/ in the middle of the day so I can walk around and exercise. Helps me digest and get better sleep. 

Moderation/ just one drink: hey, that's great for you but there's a difference between having a drink and drinking. There are very few people here who HAVEN'T struggled with moderation. I certainly have. Not really sure why, on this sub of all places the condescending attitude comes out, but it's still the internet so I guess that tracks. 

You can budget your calories! - yes, I literally say in my post ""props if you can manage it, I'm jealous"" so maybe the people who are managing well don't need to refute a piece of advice that doesn't really apply to them but does/helps others. Some real ""main character"" attitudes here. 



We all know that there's no one size fits all with weight loss. If something doesn't apply to you, maybe just recognize that it's good advice to other people and you don't need to chime in/ have a verbalized opinion on everything you see. 

To everyone who said this resonated/ it was the advice you needed to hear, much love, glad we're able to support each other on this healthy life choice. 

I've lurked this sub for a while and it was a break from drinking for reasons unrelated to weight loss that helped me start the current journey I'm on. I drink beer which is really calorie heavy. For me, I was never going to lose the weight while drinking the way I did. I wish someone had said this to me previously, so I said it for someone who needed to hear it. If one person thinks of this post and it helps them achieve their goal, I feel like I've put some good into the world.

9,2023-04-27 10:13:53-05:00,1682608433.0,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,"I (28f) am marrying my fiance James (25m) in September. We sent the invites out in January and made no mention of the fact we won't be serving alcohol at the wedding, but we won't. We will only be serving non-alcoholic options and there won't be any available for people to people to buy at the 'bar'.

I'm a recovering alcoholic (sober 4 years 7 months) but if I'm out socially and a discussion about having alcohol comes up, I always lie and tell people I'm seriously intolerant to alcohol and it makes me very sick. I just don't want people to know about my sobriety, it's none of their business. Only my best friends and immediate family know (and my fiance obviously).

James' birthday was in early April and we rented the room above a pub (yep, big fun for the recovering alcoholic as you can imagine..!) to celebrate. Convos about our wedding came up and I don't remember exactly how but I ended up talking to a group of not-so-close friends (more James' friends and my acquaintances) about the wedding. I said it was going to be an alcohol free wedding and they were pretty incredulous. Especially as James' birthday was not alcohol free. They asked why and I said I wasn't giving a reason, there's just no alcohol. They asked if I was pregnant, I said no. I just don't want alcohol at my wedding.

I was called a buzzkill and told that people go to weddings to drink, that it's polite to put money behind the bar for your guests particularly if they are evening guests. It ended up in this big debate about drinking at weddings. One of our much closer friends joined the convo and asked why I didn't just tell them all why I don't drink. I said it was none of their business, pretty rudely to be honest but I was getting pissed off at this point. One of James' friends said being honest about it was the least I could do and it was wrong of me not to at least explain myself. One of them also made a fairly unpleasant joke at my expense basically suggesting I'm the 'ball and chain' now for James.

I took myself out of the conversation because I was upset but I still don't think I owe anyone an explanation despite what they say. AITA?

Edit: a few people have brought this up so I thought I'd address it. We didn't put it on the invites because BYOB isn't really a thing here with these kinds of venues, so we figured people won't (if they do I can't stop them drinking it but I'd rather they didn't) however if we put that it's a dry wedding more people will try and bring their own. And we because we've told the venue there's no alcohol, we have to pay a very steep corkage fee if people bring it and the venue staff notice. So we'd have to pay a considerable amount if someone was really obvious about it, and we all know drunk people aren't great at secrecy!

Edit: all of my comments are being downvoted (so I guess I know how this judgement will go!) so I'm not sure if people will see my comment below on this, but I think I'm just going to mass email our guests telling the truth. It makes me feel awful to tell people I'm an alcoholic, but then I can say that it's a dry wedding and ask them not to bring alcohol, then the bandage is off and if they judge me they judge me.

We were supposed to have only one party with both sides of the family, but my sister-in-law and her husband live far away (they have not meet our baby yet, the last time we saw them was before the plague), and they postponed their visit for a week, so we had a party with my side of the family (my mom, my two siblings and their partners) last week, and another party yesterday, with my husband's side (his mom, my SiL and her husband).

As you can see, it was 2 very small gatherings. Basically, both times, we did the same thing : a meal, a cake, they gave gifts to the baby, fawned over him, took 1 billion pictures and videos, and we chatted while the baby napped for half of the party. 

I'm breastfeeding so I don't drink any alcohol, and my husband doesn't like alcohol much, so he stopped along with me. We didn't even think about buying alcohol for the parties (because the last time we've bought alcohol was like... 2 years ago, lol)

I thought the party with my family-in-law went well and everyone was happy, until I received a text from my MiL this morning, asking me why I didn't serve alcohol, and that it was poor taste to neglect my guests. It seems my SiL is very upset because of me, because she thinks I was cheap when they came all the way to see us and bring gifts for our baby.
To be clear, my husband was the one who planned the second party, and he bought sodas and juices because that's what he wanted to buy, I don't know why I'm being blamed.

The thing is, not serving alcohol for a party IS rare and kinda weird here, but my family didn't say anything about it, so we just went with the same plan for the second party..

And before anyone says anything about my husband, he called his mom and asked what the hell was going on, and said if they're not happy with our way of hosting, they don't have to come next time.

I guess I'm asking if we are the a**hole because it seems extreme to not have them over again for such a small issue, we can just buy alcohol next time.

EDIT : There are a lot more comments than what I thought, thank you all for your judgement for such a small issue.

To answer the most frequent questions : we're French, they were expecting wine with the meal and champagne with the cake, and it was lunch and the afternoon after that, they left around 6PM.

Husband is still super mad at them, but as far as I'm concerned, the issue is solved. Next time, we'll say in advance we don't have alcohol and if they want to drink, they can bring their own bottle(s).

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ubfdx/aita_for_throwing_my_brothers_alcoholism_back_in/)**: April 21, 2023**

For context: I (20F) in the US where the drinking age is 21.

Both of my parents died by the time I was 10. My older brother, Charlie (then 19, now 29), ghosted. He was an alcoholic and felt it was all too much. It’s a choice I now understand as an adult, but as a kid, of course it hurt. I was raised by both my grandmother and older sister, Renee (then 17, now 27). My grandmother did all she could, but she was older and relied on Renee a lot.

When I was 17, Charlie came back into our lives, 2 years sober. Renee and I forgave him. I am now very close to him and we’ve bonded a lot. I actually live with him now while I go to college because he lives literally right up the road.

I do party on occasion, but it’s very rare I get drunk. Now, I always assumed that Charlie knew I drank. I’m in college. Not every college student parties, but when I’m at out past midnight, I figure it’s obvious I’m not playing Scrabble or whatever.

I crashed at a friend’s on Wednesday night after having a bit too much to drink. I returned to Charlie’s, hungover. It wasn’t quite obvious at first but then I started throwing up. He figured it out and began lecturing me. Said I’m 20, not legally able to drink, it’s not safe to get wasted at a college party. Told me that I shouldn’t drink at all at my age. He wasn’t yelling, more matter of fact than anything.

I wasn’t feeling great, had a headache and found his rant hypocritical. I told him such. He started drinking at 15, had a huge problem at 19. He abandoned our family when we needed him most. He has no right to judge me or act like a protective big brother now. Charlie got quiet, walked out of the room and later left for work. He hasn’t said much to me since. He’s definitely not mad, just sad and hurt.

Renee told me I crossed a line. While she’s fine with me drinking and thinks Charlie overreacted a little, she said I went way too far in throwing back all that in his face. Especially as I’ve never brought it up before. She says the most I should’ve said was that I was safe while drinking and I understood his concern, but I could do what I wanted as an adult.

I’m starting to feel bad. Was I wrong?

***Relevant Comments:***

*Someone points out brother may have been worried for her safety:*

""I didn’t consider that he was worried about me being vulnerable around guys. I just thought he was talking about driving, which I didn’t do. I walked to a friend’s dorm.""

*You share a genetic predisposition for alcoholism:* 

""While I don’t think I have a problem, our mom was a heroin addict and it contributed to her death. Her mom was an alcoholic. Pretty sure her sister was too. So, it is genetic. Doesn’t mean I have it, but the commenter and my brother aren’t wrong to be concerned, I’m learning.""

""Yeah, I didn’t know much about the genetic part but when you said it and I look at our family history…you’re not far off. I don’t think I have a problem but it certainly is genetic in our family.""

*Many people point out just how much OOP overreacted:* 

""You’re absolutely right. I’m definitely becoming embarrassed.""

*It wasn't your brother's responsibility to care for you:*

""I don’t think he had a responsibility to take care of anyone. I do think he had a responsibility to just not up and leave. So maybe people are right. Maybe I am not really over it.""

""I’ve thought about therapy a lot. I guess it’s time to think about it more.""

**Update (Same Post): April 22, 2023 (Next Day)**

Update: First of all, thank you for being so honest with me. A lot of it was very hard to read and I didn’t want to accept it, but I know I needed to.

I still do not think I have a drinking problem. I know that’s what every alcoholic says, but I truly do not get as drunk as I did that often. At the same time, I recgonize addiction is genetic and Charlie is not the only person in our family that struggles with it. Considering that, I am going to take a break from drinking for a little while and if/when I start again in the future (after I turn 21 at a minimum), I will be more careful when it comes to how much I consume and the venue in which I consume it.

A lot of you pointed out that Charlie was right about the safety concern. I was getting wasted at a college party. I didn’t include this in the post, which is unfair looking back as it’s important context, but none of my friends were sober either. So, I had no one looking out for me nor was I looking out for myself. I see now all the things that could’ve happened.

The big takeaway is that I am not “okay” or “over” with what happened. I buried it down because I just wanted a relationship with my brother again and then as soon as I was reminded of that time, I lashed out. I plan to look into finding a therapist because clearly, there’s a lot of unresolved issues.

Finally, I knew early on after posting that I owed Charlie an apology. I ordered dinner for us last night and apologized. I said I understood that he was concerned and he had every right to be. I also said I had no right to throw everything back in his face. Charlie apologized for everything he put the family through, but I told him that he already had. He repeated that he was just very worried about me turning into him. I thanked him for his concern and told him I’m grateful for him, I love him.

I am not foolish to think everything is okay. He knows now that I’m struggling with everything. I also can’t take back the words I said or what a brat I was. But we’re going to try moving forward and find healing.

trigger warnings: &gt;!animal abuse, cruelty, mention of child abuse!&lt; 

&amp;#x200B;

[**ORGINAL POST**](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/916n20/help_seeking_advice_from_anyone_that_had/) \- 23rd July 2018

I need advice from anyone that's treated a dog that has developed a substance abuse disorder, specifically (in this case) alcohol.

I was visiting some distant relatives and went around to their neighbours place. These guys are both fuckwits and animal hoarders. One of their dogs 'ticks' was that it could drink a half bottle of wine (350mls, \~12.5US fluid ounces, of 11% alc/vol). They wouldn't feed him until he completed this 'trick', which he must do twice a day, and is repeated everyday. They think it's a great laugh... I think it's cruel as fuck. They are getting sick of him though because now he no longer staggers around after consuming the alcohol and said that they are think about getting rid of him (which means a bullet in these parts). I offered to take him, and they accepted.

Problem is, the dog seems to go absolutely berserk, and then looks in pain, before staggering around in fright if I don't give him a small glass (100mls) of wine. Before I realised this, I opened a bottle of wine myself and took a swig, and he leapt up on me desperately licking my lips and sticking his tongue in my mouth... I didn't know if it was a physiological or psychological dependence.

I've taken him to my vet (whom estimated his age at 6 years old), who has said this is a rather unusual situation and alcoholism treatment hasn't been studied widely in dogs, but this dog is likely physically dependent on alcohol and he's going through the ""DT's"" just like human alcoholics do when they are cut off from alcohol 'cold turkey'.

My vet said he couldn't professionally recommend I keep giving the dog alcohol, nor could he think of a specialist that could help. Off the record he suggested that I wean the dog down, 50mls a week until his consumption is at 100mls a day, then down by 10mls a day, until 10mls. At 10mls to reduce it 1 ml a day every 2-3 days. He also 'off the record' suggested to be flexible, to put up with 'whining' for more, but if he shows withdrawal symptoms to give a little more if it helps, but to be careful not to teach the dog the 'trick' of acting in withdrawal just to get more wine.

I really want to help this guy, as he is amazingly sweet. I find it sickening that whenever my hands go above roughly my shoulder height he covers (I'm thinking he's been hit a lot maybe?) and he freaks out at the sight of a rolled up newspaper... poor boy.

I know it's a long shot, but what do you recommend? The vet said that he would consider giving valium as that may ease withdrawals, but as that isn't safe to mix with alcohol I have to decide whether I'm going to give him valium and promise no alcohol, or just wean him down on alcohol slowly.

I already own a boxer (probably not pure though), and as this guy seems to be a red-heeler crossed with a boxer, he and my other dog are getting on like a house on fire! It's so great to watch them both play and be so happy! That is, until my poor new boy needs another drink and becomes so anxious and pained :-/

Any advice? I feel quite unsure of what the best way to rehab him is, and am worried that general veterinary principles (i.e. ""never give your dog alcohol) might interfere with whats best in this extremely nuanced situation. I feel like it's so unfair this guy is suffering because of being made to do 'party tricks' when he is so affectionate, and somehow even still has a spark in his eye and hasn't just shut off to the world despite how cruel the hand he was dealt has been...

(Removed for fear of doxxing, given I got an abusive/treatening call from relatives, it seems the police have acted!)

**EDIT 2:** I have called the police. Despite the fact they aren't proactive, I had taken photos of an active amateur meth lab and firearms that were neither being stored correctly, and likely not owned by someone with relevant paperwork. THIS may be investigated, remembering it's a 'fly-in fly-out' community, or a \~40 hour return trip from nearest police OUTPOST, and longer from proper police station. The settlement may have already had a visit from the police, or if they haven't they may have soon. Hopefully it's the proper police and not the 'tribal justice' administration that has no real power OR interest in these sorts of things. One of the people involved in 'training' the dog to do the trick is a retired member.

**UPDATE:**

Have spoken to my vet friend, who has discussed it with another vet. They have decided that despite the law, given the unique circumstances, the are confident despite statute that an alcoholic wean wouldn't be considered abuse. I am going to wean him down at a rate slightly quicker than the one originally suggested (in the post), but be monitoring him constantly for signs that he is in withdrawal, in which case I'll let him have a small amount and re-assess in 45 minutes. I also have some IM Valium that I'm to give him if he has a seizure, before immediately transporting him to the hospital. The vet will look him over twice a week at his clinic, monitoring his weight and have another liver test done in a few weeks!

It seems police have acted, as I received a call from one of said relatives (whom live nextdoor) shouting about police being there etc. and hanging up. I blocked their number.Thank you all for you kind comments and advice. I will update you guys in a couple of weeks to let you know how it's going!

**EDIT TO ADD TO UPDATE:** He's been switched to cheap cider, from wine, which he wasn't sure of at first, but after he realised it was alcoholic (about after 15 minutes I'd coaxed him to have some when he was starting to get agitated and restless) he then wanted more. Makes me really think it's not a 'taste' thing at all, he just has become so dependent he needs the alcohol in him to feel 'normal'... poor guy.

 

[**UPDATE - 1: Alcoholic Dog’s Recovery Is Going Well!**](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/937y0b/update_alcoholic_dogs_recovery_is_going_well/) \- 31st July 2018

[Photo of him today](https://imgur.com/FiAnkWN)

The treatment is going fantastically!!! From originally having 750mls of 11.5% wine a day, my new doggo only needs 200mls of 7.9% apple cider (50mls 4 times a day). This dose is enough to keep him happy, follow me around and jump around playing with my other dog, to enjoying laying on my legs, under the covers on my bed, and just doing everything that a happy dog does. He has MAJOR anxiety issues if he can’t be with me or my partner, for example just going to the shop for 2 minutes and leaving him in the yard or inside (his pick) I will come home to him whimpering and barking in a distressed manner, only to then have him to try and lick my face off when he finds I’ve returned!

Just before the time of his next dose, he often slows down and shows some signs of agitation (i.e. increased pulse rate, not interested in playing or food) but once he’s had the next ‘dose’ of cider he picks back up again fairly quickly. Despite the taper going quicker than originally it was thought he would need, there has been no signs of the SERIOUS withdrawal symptoms. Because of his livers state, we want him to be off alcohol as quick as possible (without causing more than mild withdrawal) and thus are very pleased. The vet today considers it safe for him to take a small dose of valium, to be given ‘in between’ his drinks, 4 times a day. This should help with his agitation etc.

I’m so hopeful that this will work out, because he’s fitted in with our family and other pets (indoors we have 2 cats and 1 dog) perfectly and is such a sweet guy. We’ve already bonded so closely, it’s a perfect match!

The plan from here is to try and get him down to a very low intake (60mls of 7.9% apple cider per day, given in 4 doses) within 2 weeks, and then decrease at a slower rather (1ml to 2mls per day) as often in alcoholics they can wean down to low doses without TOO much trouble from withdrawals, but ‘jumping off’ is very hard to achieve without severe withdrawals. During this time his valium dose may be increased to help with what he’s going through inside.

I'm just so glad things seem to be going so well, and that he seems so happy. His temperment also has made him slot in with our existing dog and 2 cats nicely.

I am posting here to let you know that today ‘Digger’ (Doggo's new name) has successfully gone 24 hours without consuming any alcohol, and seems to be fine… not quite as ‘chipper’ as usual, but certainly not suffering as much as one may expect. As you can see from these photo's he may look a little sorry for himself but still can give a smile and a yawn when woken up with a belly rub!

1. [https://imgur.com/jWicRMM](https://imgur.com/jWicRMM) 2) [https://imgur.com/biiC2PD](https://imgur.com/biiC2PD)

***TL;DR:*** *Digger has successfully gone for 24 hours without alcohol, is showing no serious complications related to withdrawal, and is on meds that seem to be controlling his symptoms well enough! Although he has some temporary liver impairment, he is expected to make a full recovery, and therefore today marks the first day of the rest of his new, SOBER, life as this man's best friend!*

 

[**UPDATE - 3: Digger (the former Alcoholic Dog) has been alcohol free for 14 days now, and off all medication for 3 days!**](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/994frn/update_digger_the_former_alcoholic_dog_has_been/) \- 21st August 2018

Firstly, I’m sorry I haven’t updated for a while. I’ve been unwell lately so having quite a bit of bed rest… however Digger has been loyally keeping me company, and I’ve pushed myself to make sure he gets plenty of stimulation from walks and such when he feels able to!

The Update (Good News Folks!):

Well, let me preface this by saying that Digger has been progressing excellently. The first 3-4 days without alcohol (and tapering down his Valium) were fairly rough on him, and he was obviously feeling uncomfortable and unhappy, but after 5 days when I offered him a leash he EXCITEDLY jumped up to go on the walk (the first time since he’s been alcohol free). I walked him to the dog park, where he even did some off leash RUNNING (just with myself and my other dog Chester, whom while normally will play fairly rough has sensed Digger has been hurting and thus has been gentle). However, he and Chester have been playing in their normal ‘spirited’ fashion again and it seems that Digger is completely over any withdrawal symptoms… I simply cannot believe this dog is no completely chemical free after being given so much artificial stuff (first by his owners abusing him, and then secondly by me trying to help him)… he’s coped remarkably well with the treatment, and to think that a number of vets suggested he be put to sleep!

Just to show what I mean about Digger being a happy boy, here is an album of 4 photo’s of him I took just now! [https://imgur.com/a/fSCogqc](https://imgur.com/a/fSCogqc)

The last photo is a bit soppy, but he’s so sweet… always wanting to lick my face. Funnily enough, after my girl and I have been kissing, he often comes up and starts wanting to lick my face as though he thinks that that is just how we say ‘hello’ around here! Sometimes no matter how much I try and protest he won’t settle till he atleast gets the tip of his tongue to touch my cheek!

As for medical stuff, one of the hardest tight-ropes for my vet and I were walking was his Valium dosage. It clearly has alleviated the muscular aches and pains associated with alcohol withdrawal, but at the same time, we didn’t want him to become physically dependent on it so wanted him off it (or on a low dosage) so he wouldn’t suffer withdrawal when he had to cease the medication.

Fortunately, he was able to taper down quite rapidly with the discomfort from his withdrawal from the alcohol seemingly being roughly in line with his decrease in dose of Valium… except for the last couple of days where he’s been feeling even better and, as mentioned has been excited to have physical activity including going for walks, a run at the off leash dog park, playing tug of war with Chester (my other dog). It seems that what I’d feared the most, jumping off the Valium completely, turned out to be a non-issue…. I guess because dogs require such large doses maybe he wasn’t feeling anything from what was left and the days he seemed a bit lethargic from the Valium reduction was the time he ‘actually’ jumped off it? :-S Either way, I’m so happy for him!0

But one of the things I’m most thrilled to tell you is… Digger has discovered the joys of playing with toys!!! As I mentioned before, he has seemingly never has a proper toy (i.e. a plush toy or something with a ‘squeaker’ in it) but he’s starting to learn what they are and he LOVES them! He’s got a rubber pig that ‘oinks’ when squeezed plus a miniature plush horse. The horse, though, is slowly having it’s stuffing spread over the house as he seems to enjoy pulling it apart haha.

His social anxiety is also getting better, he’s able to be left alone for \~5 minutes without getting worried in a room or other ‘boring’ situation, and for about 15 minutes in a situation that is somewhat exciting i.e. outside where he can see from our backyard through our front yard and into the street… observing people and other dogs coming and going. He’s really become part of our family, and while he’s still very attached to me, he’s also becoming more endeared to my partner and also my stepdad. He’s content to be ‘minded’ by them if I’ve had to be out all day or something like that!

A lot of you have been asking about the legal situation with his former owners and their charges. After consulting with the mods, I am not allowed post a link to the newspaper article or give enough information they could be identified (although I’ve given enough that anyone with reasonable googlefu and Australian geography knowledge could put it together). That said, as I mentioned previously the Man and Woman whom owned digger previously, (the ones who gave him alcohol and were going to shoot him), are being held in custody on firearms and drugs charges awaiting their trial. However, in addition I’ve read that they are both facing 2 counts of sexual assault of a minor. As the minor wasn’t identified, I don’t know for sure, but I think I mentioned in a previous post I had suspected something was off and it wouldn’t surprise me if it was their own son and daughter whom are the victims.

However, I know through the grapevine that now at least 10 children have been removed from the settlement by the department of child services, including a couple of my relatives, and they have been placed with foster parents. The police AND child services are taking a very hard look at the community as whole, and I wouldn’t be surprised if there are both more charges, and the community collapses due to the fact that almost all residents are facing some legal or social interventions by government agencies. While normally I would be sad about a tribe ceasing to exist, and in a way I still am, I am not sorry for the people involved. They were horrible human beings whom tolerated such depraved activity and used their remoteness to keep it hidden from authorities. Maybe once the tribe was ‘noble’, but I know what they have become is not something that can be overlooked by society, and what has happened is for the good of the children (and Digger) and the adults largely brought this on themselves. They had enough good land they could have made a reasonable living farming, but instead decided to sexually abuse children and to perform egregious animal cruelty. :-|

On a more positive note, I just want to say a giant THANK YOU to the r/dogs community for your support during this. At first I was very unsure of myself, and how this would go, but I am staggered and humbled at the amount of great practical advice I got, plus the enormous amount of encouragement to keep trying my best even when I wasn’t sure.

I really wish that I had some way to let Digger know how many people around the world have been following his recovering and thinking of him, some to the point of tearing up, but the best I can do is just give him unlimited belly rubs. I also should thank my vet for going well and truly above the call of duty. For checking him physical examination every 3-4 days, and having done 4 liver and kidney panels on him, along with the medication, I tallied it up and have only spent \~$750aud in total. I believe him when he says he is charging me exactly what it costs him to get the pathology tests done and the medication, and I also think he is courageous for assisting me despite the animal cruelty laws specifically stating that it is illegal to give a dog alcohol without exception, and thus putting his license potentially on the line by giving me the advice on how to wean him down!

I am definitely blessed by having Digger join my family, and now can’t really imagine life without him. He’s slotted in just so perfectly with all of us. I’m also really glad that I have a happy ending for his saga to tell you. I will be sure to give an update in 6 months or so to let you know if he’s still going on the straight and narrow etc., but I think for now Digger has successfully beaten his alcohol dependence, as his last liver screen came back showing it’s improved a little already… Go digger :’-)

I’m sorry I haven’t updated for a while. I've been in and out of hospital a bit and trying to juggle work (working 'from home' isn't so great when your in a hospital and need to be relaxing). Anyhow, I'm really happy to report that I consider that Digger is cured... he's not needed any alcohol of meds for well over a month now, and blood-work I received today shows his liver function as normal... How amazing is that?

To start off, [here's a photo my partner took of him on the way back from the vets today!](https://imgur.com/a/HjhMfCv). (Note all the dog hair on my arm where he nuzzles me while I drive haha)

***TL;DR quick background:*** *A family had been feeding their dog the equivalent of 1 bottle of full strength wine (half in morning, half at night) every day for more than 6 months as they thought it was funny to see the dog be drunk and classed it as a ‘trick’ that he must do or they wouldn’t feed him. When I met these people they were getting sick of the dog due to him no longer acting drunk despite him drinking so much, and were planning on shooting him. I saved them a bullet, but the dog was physically dependent on alcohol and needed to be given some regularly to stop him from becoming agitated and eventually just laying on the floor trembling, throwing up, with a glassy stare. After some initial hesitation due to laws against giving dogs alcohol, a vet (whom is a personal friend) decided to help me treat him and gave me meds to help the dog through ‘withdrawal’ and will help assess his taper.*

*Liver and kidney tests initially showed he has liver impairment, but not to an extent that was irrecoverable or that is likely to falter soon. His kidneys showed a mild impairment but no immediate danger, though he may have issues in his older age. However, more recent testing as I weaned him completely off alcohol have shown already an improvement in his liver function! I reported his owners to the police, as I had taken photo's of their illegally owned and stored firearms, as well as an amateur meth lab. This resulted in a raid on the property with many adults arrested, and children being taken into care because either both their parents are now being held in custody OR they were found to be being severely neglected i.e. some as old as \~12 had never been to school and were completely illiterate. It doesn't look like their will be any charges over the animal cruelty, though I have been asked to testify (via video link due to the distance) at a couple of upcoming trials and it's fairly certain that those responsible will end up in jail (especially with the new sexual assault of a minor charges they have received, detailed below).*

I told him to invite any of his friends and girlfriend and am planning to invite family and a few of our mutual friends. Today, he told me that his gf requests we make the BBQ a non-alcoholic event, as his gf is uncomfortable around alcohol (she’s never drank before due to anxiety issues). 

I responded that there will be non-alcoholic and alcoholic options for anyone’s preferences. I firmly believe that if an event I’m planning is at my house, I shouldn’t have to tell a group of people not to do something in order to make one person happy. Everyone is entitled to their own preferences and life style choices. What do you guys think?

EDIT to add: Thank y’all for the responses! Really enjoying reading all of your perspectives. 

To answer some of your questions: 
(1) she doesn’t live at our house 
(2) my brother passed along the request, he doesn’t have a preference for whether alcohol is there or not 
(3) the bbq is for him and to celebrate his big achievement. I am having a separate birthday bbq with my friends at our house for my own birthday a few weeks later. Not making the day anything about my preferences, just trying to make sure all who attend are happy and able to do what they enjoy (drink or not drink). My families enjoys doing BBQs to just relax and play games/ sports outside. 
(4) Drinking is not the priority for the event, spending quality time together is. We are all in our mid/late 20s and 30s and are not huge party people, some people choose not to drink, some people choose to enjoy beverages with their meals. There’s no pressure to partake or not partake in either option.

1. My brother ordered a single drink for his first birthday celebration since being out of the church. One of his longtime friends who is very TBM happened to bring her high school daughters unannounced. After the party, she called him saying that they were so disappointed and on their drive home, she had to have a “hard conversation” with her daughters when they said “I can’t believe he was drinking alcohol in front of us.”

2. My close friend’s husband was drinking a beer, and her dad confronted him saying “I can’t believe you have the nerve to drink that in front of me.”

3. My father-in-law has been out for a while, but my TBM sister-in-law often calls us and vents about finding alcohol in his fridge whenever she visits him. (She doesn’t know we’re out.)

And now, here we are, this same sister-in-law from the above is coming to visit us this weekend and we’re trying to finish our alcohol as quickly as we can so we don’t “offend her”. But I’m here trying to think of WHY does this offend people. I understand they feel hurt because we’re “dooming our salvation”, but I’m genuinely trying to wrap my head around being sad about it vs. being offended over it and how to respectfully move forward with this.

EDIT: I’m not ready to discuss this with family members, but I also don’t intend to keep this a secret for my whole life. This is preparing me for when I’m ready to have this discussion with family. Please be respectful that I want to take this at my own pace.

I (31F) have an amazing son (almost 8) who is incredibly sweet, well-mannered and inquisitive. (Although, I guess most parents think of their kids that way.)

I quit drinking about 2 months ago and have been adamant about doing the AA program correctly - 90 meetings in 90 days, sponsor, daily readings, therapy, etc. I really want to be a good mom and make up for my bad decisions when I was drinking. (I never harmed him or put him in danger but I just wasn’t present and am remorseful about my drinking past.)

The problem is that I’m a single mom who works full-time and I live in a small town. Because it’s small, there aren’t a lot of options in terms of AA meetings, so the only one I can really attend is the 5:30 based on my schedule and my son’s. His father has him part-time, so on those days, I can attend meetings by myself but on my days I HAVE to bring my son. I don’t have anyone to leave him with and babysitting wouldn’t work because nobody wants to babysit for just one hour - it doesn’t financially make sense for them.

So, I take my son to meetings. Naturally, he isn’t too thrilled when I have to. (Before you suggest I could do zoom meetings, i really don’t get anything out of them. I like the in-person connection and atmosphere).

My ex (who has never taken my alcoholism seriously and has never actually attended an AA meeting) says I’m TA for exposing our child to “that kind of atmosphere” and “those kinds of people.” The truth is, “those people” are what have saved my life. They are so sweet and good with my son and, while sometimes the subject matter can be a little adult-ish, we mostly talk about how to be better people and live a spiritually-sound existence and to help our fellow man. I personally think it’s good for my son to be surrounded by people that are trying to better themselves and also to let him know at an early age the effects of alcoholism as it runs in my family, but maybe I’m TA and way off the mark and am doing more damage than good. I would just like outside opinions that aren’t emotionally connected to the situation.

AITA for taking my 7 year old to AA meetings with some of the topics that are addressed?

Edit: I super appreciate everyone’s responses! It gave me a lot of insight. Admittedly, I didn’t really think about how other members may feel about having a child there - I was mostly thinking about the comfort of my son. I WILL say that the group is all old-timers that have years of sobriety and largely just talk about service work and how much better their lives are. But, as many have pointed out, the presence of a child may deter members from talking about serious subjects, so I’ll either just give my kid headphones and a tablet to play with (something I usually hate doing but I guess I’ll just have to suck it up) or do zoom meetings when I have him. Again, thank you for ALL of the input (even the ppl that were incredibly harsh with their verdict).

***UPDATE***

First and most importantly, I’m still sober and feel better than I have in years. I can now be more present and a better mom to my child, and for that, I’m incredibly grateful. AA has quite literally saved my life and if anyone who is reading this struggles with addiction, I just want to say there IS a way out - you just have to know YOU ARE WORTH IT and SOBRIETY is worth it.

My first post ended up being a mixed bag in terms of judgements about my assholery. I accept my judgment of being the AH but I did want to clarify a common misconception. Abstaining from alcohol is just a small portion of AA. A much larger portion is dedicated to is looking into WHY we drink, take accountability for our selfish actions and apologize accordingly and to rectify our character defects so we can be better ppl to our friends and family. Because of these aspects, I was hoping exposing my son to the program would teach him something about accountability, patience, and empathy.

I ended up just asking my AA home group if it bothered them that I brought my son to meetings. Not only did everyone look at me like I grew a second head for even asking for permission, every parent in the group talked about their own children growing up in AA and how “you do what you have to do to stay sober.” Essentially, the consensus was that it is far better for a kid to have to be dragged to meetings a few hours a week than to have a mom drunk all the time.

I still take my son to AA meetings, but now I allow him to play on my tablet with headphones. (I got reamed in the comments for not allowing my kid to do this before. Fair enough. I just have this “thing” about kids being on technology as a quick fix for boredom, but I need to get over that.)

My son gets a lot of treats and gifts from my home group members. One dude gives him $10s and $20s every time he sees my son (I know, right? Untapped resource!). My son is learning how to play electric guitar, and two AA members will rift with my son and talk music (Jimmy Hendrix is currently my son’s hero). All in all, my son likes the attention and says he doesn’t mind going to meetings.

A surprising update in all of this is that my son’s dad has stopped drinking. (Although he currently refuses to attend AA). My relationship with my ex is much better and my kiddo seems much happier as a whole.

Life for all of us is just… better. And while I don’t want to turn this into a public endorsement for AA, I just want to say that sobriety is hands-down the best thing that’s ever happened to my family.",t2_95u4hpflc,AITA for making my 7-year-old go to Alcoholics Anonymous? + Update,t3_12psv0h,12psv0h,roolp,512,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/12psv0h/aita_for_making_my_7yearold_go_to_alcoholics/,0.98,5723,alcohol,0.0988186374306678,0.0138041777536273,0.0606520883738994,0.0176924932748079,0.0298992730677127,0.1755766868591308,0.0143211996182799,0.0178468227386474,0.5616032481193542,0.0097854612395167,0.9845640659332275,0.015435961075127125

have many more stories about my workplace, but this one is really sticking with me. 

As some of you may remember, I work as a hostess at a country club. Often times, when I am not busy, I’ll help the servers with bussing and table turnovers. And other times, servers will take a short break to come up and chat with me (I.e. complain about a particularly irritating/nasty customer). 

This particular night, about two months ago, nothing really special was happening. It was a little busy, but it wasn’t insane. A normal weeknight, I suppose. Imagine my surprise when one of my servers (20NB) jogs past my stand to the offices. I shrugged it off, thinking they might have some food in the kitchen they needed to get out. Nothing too uncommon, but this server usually doesn’t run like that. 

Five minutes later, they comes back and leans an arm on the stand, sighing.

“OP, what do you think of when I say “Dirty Shirley Temple”?”

“Uh, a Shirley Temple with alcohol in it. Why?”

“That’s what I thought, too!” They whisper scream to me. Oh boy, what kind of crooked fuckery has been brought upon us this time?

“I’m almost afraid to ask, but what happened?”

“The lady in the middle booth asked me for a ‘dirty Shirley Temple’. I asked her twice if she really meant she wanted it dirty. She drank two of them, but now she doesn’t want to pay for the drinks because she didn’t order alcohol in it.”

Record scratch. Blue screen. Television snow from the 90s. Somehow, I managed to snap myself out.

“What else did she think dirty meant? A dirty glass?!”

“I don’t know, OP, but did I mess up?” At this point, they’re upset because they thought they ruined someone’s AA or something.

“No way, that lady is in her 40s, minimum. Even if she didn’t know that dirty meant alcohol, she would have either tasted it or figured it out after the second drink.”

I don’t remember much more because we had to get back to work, though I did go back and take another look at this lady just to be sure my eyes weren’t playing tricks on me. They were not, she was greying at the temples. The lady ended up getting the drinks comped (I guess she put up a big enough fuss to management), but this is truly one of the more baffling things we’ve come across. The server is still annoyed by this story, too. I mean, it was two shots of vodka that she essentially got for free.",t2_9x0uor71,“I didn’t order alcohol in my dirty drink!”,t3_12si80s,12si80s,ThePathUntaken,290,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/12si80s/i_didnt_order_alcohol_in_my_dirty_drink/,0.96,1748,alcohol,0.0513547882437706,0.0238530486822128,0.3190119862556457,0.0708119794726371,0.0815372690558433,0.3153675496578216,0.0199145600199699,0.0393636785447597,0.0483251735568046,0.0304599776864051,0.9576449990272522,0.04235498607158661

I suppose everyone is thinking ""oh, but you are way more mature when you are 21, than when you are 18"". Guess what, you are still a young adult. You will make stupid desicions when it comes to alcohol that age (not everyone of course, but very many).

I believe that if the age is lower, as many countries in Europe, the teenagers till buy their own booze safely from the drugstore or liquor shop, instead of buying from an acquaintance or even a stranger, because that is the reality. Most people start experimenting with alcohol in their late teens (15,16, 17) and if they have a drinking age at 18, I would say it is a lot safer, than if you have it up to 21.

I find it concerning how you can legally own a firearm at the age of 18 in the US, but buying a can of beer? Oh heavens forbid it!!! How do they trust a kid owning a gun, but not drinking alcohol?

I was in the hospital for a month. During this time, and without my knowledge, my roommate was using my computer to buy themselves frivolous things and completely drain my bank account without my knowledge. I just confronted them and they admitted to purchasing some things but not everything that is listed on my online banking. I told him that he is no longer allowed to use my money under any circumstances. He makes less than half than me on Ontario Works and I don't care if he starves at this point. He messaged me on the 3rd or 4th saying that he had not money left and was suspicious as to how he was surviving up until now, I got home a few days ago to an empty fridge and my suspicions only grew. Today I received an email from my bank that I only had $100 left in my account and that if it went under that I would be paying extra fines. Additionally, while I was away, he adopted a cat that has no shots and straight up attacks my cat, who is a very friendly creature. I tried separating them today and his cat attacked my face. I've now told him as well that his cat cannot leave the spare bedroom anymore. What can I do to get my money back and get this roommate out of my apartment?

I have now informed the roommate that he is not welcome back, I have the key so he cannot get in, and informed him that when he is ready to come take what little things he has, he is free to. Unfortunately until then I will be taking care of a Hamster and an additional cat. I am cleaning up all of his things currently, when I am done, I will be calling the police, and on Monday I will be going to the bank to get another card and have my old one discontinued.

A Police Report has been filed and they will likely be here sometime today.

They are coming today to get their pets and ""some of their belongings.""

Why do we think the people who consider themselves critical thinkers can't see this? I'm 1000% more productive as a sober person. If everyone were to eliminate alcohol, I imagine we would have a much more cohesive society.

I picked up This Naked Mind again which I had been afraid of since the last time I started reading it because it threatened to expose the lies of alcohol once and for all. I started to read about what alcohol does to my brain, to my risk of various cancers, to my anxiety levels, and to my body generally. I listened to other podcasts like “Take a Break from Drinking,” where I heard my own inner thoughts coming from someone else who had been through it. For some reason, this time, it all resonated with me. 

It’s now been one year since I made the decision to stop drinking. In that time period, I have had plenty of longing thoughts where I am jealous of someone on TV drinking or think about a “special meal” that would be made “more special” by pairing it with alcohol. But those are both lies. The truth is, plenty of people do not drink and enjoy their lives immensely. Plenty of food tastes better without having alcohol deaden your tastebuds. The fear of missing out is trumped by the fear of what alcohol does to my body and the consequences it can have. I used to think, “Why would people quit?” and now I think, “Why would people drink?”

I have now gone to weddings, vacations, work functions, happy hours, and spent the holidays not drinking. I have hosted dinner parties and brunches without drinking. I have spent my birthday and New Years Eve not drinking. Every evening, I get to bed by a reasonable hour and am no longer kept up by a sense of needing to belong while drinking. I wake up early in the morning without my stomach roiling or my head pounding or my mouth filled with cotton and I am excited to get out of bed and into the early morning air. 

I was able to have major surgery and recovery well and quickly because alcohol did not impede my healing process. I’ve been able to start (and continue) CrossFit without alcohol telling me to sleep in the next morning or it keeping me from building muscle. When my tiny dog got into a bar of dark chocolate at 8pm, I was able to drive her to the emergency vet because I had not been drinking. I have driven myself home from parties, I have been able to help a friend at night. I am aware and awake. 

My blood pressure is down. I’ve been able to build muscle. My skin is clear. My friends and family have all remarked that I seem happy, content. Anxiety is a whisper, when before it was a roar. The day has so many more hours in it now that I am not forgetting some. 

I don’t know why this 30 day break turned into a year, the longest I’ve gone since I started drinking in college. I don’t know why this time was different or why I was finally ready to hear about all the negative effects alcohol has on my system and finally say, “I am unwilling to pay that price.” All I know is I finally see that alcohol “does not spark joy,” and it’s better for me to let it go. Now I keep my vices to dessert and watching entirely too much reality TV. I have hopes that it will continue to be like this for the rest of my life, but for now—IWNDWYT.

Improvements I have seen: better sleep, anxiety is manageable, being present with relationships has fostered better connections, saved thousands of dollars on booze, and I love myself again.  Really though, the lack of waking up at 3am with little to no recollection of what I may or may not have done for the last 1-2 hours before I passed out has been the best.  The anxiety/downward spiral that came with that pattern each and every time I did it (which was regularly) SUCKED!  If you are on day 1 or day 10000, keep on doing you, you can do it!!

I read [this](https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/04-01-2023-no-level-of-alcohol-consumption-is-safe-for-our-health) article which talked about how recent studies prove that ***any*** amount of alcohol has a negative impact on your body. For the longest time, I heard that moderate amounts were okay. Even healthy. Not that I drank moderate amounts all the time, I'll be honest. Some nights are hard and it's what I turned to. But now knowing it increases cancer risk at *any* amount?... That just hit me differently and made me see alcohol differently... I can't play the ""Oh it won't happen to me."" card either.

134,2023-05-07 11:57:15-05:00,1683478635.0,Psychonaut,t5_2qplv,"Before I get into my trip, I feel like some background is needed about me. I have gone through so really hard times in recent years. My best friend got involved in some illegal things and was killed by police 1/21 and my wife who I had a very toxic relationship with took her own life in front of me 9/21. 

Things were really bad for awhile and I was really struggling, especially with my mindset on life and I went through a period I was constantly having intrusive thoughts about everything, why am I here, why did these bad things happen, etc.. I have also been struggling heavily with my job as it is monotonous, high stress, and can be a chaotic environment. I think it triggers some PTSD like symptoms at times.

But over time things have gotten much better. I started dating, met someone I thought was a step in the right direction but I saw similarities in the toxicity I have been attracting. I chose to end the relationship, take a break and work on myself physically, mentally, and emotionally. 

I lost a ton of weight starting feeling better about myself. I started micro and macrodosing to actually heal myself using meditation instead of using recreationally. Some of these trips were enlightening and some were incredibly difficult, but they all taught me something about fixing myself. I eventually met my girlfriend who now lives with me. I could go on and on about how incredible she is. 

One thing I have struggled to remove from my life is my dependence on alcohol. I drank daily for probably almost 10 years. I was never a angry drunk and I feel like I have only hurt myself. My main reason for drinking was that it numbed my pain and emotions. So anytime I felt an uncomfortable thought or feeling I would drink. 

MY TRIP: On Friday night I drank half a handle of vodka because I was stressed at work this week. Earlier in the week I planned to trip on Saturday.

I went back and forth that morning on whether I should trip because I had a terrible headache and felt incredibly hungover. I am very experienced with psychedelics and I am 100% aware this was my first mistake. 

I finally decide to take 4.3g of z-strains. They kick in after about an hour and a half. I essential start feeling incredibly irritable and I tried everything to change my mindset, but I felt complete disinterest in everything. Meanwhile my headache is getting even worse. 

I decide to lay down in bed in the dark. I start seeing a entity that I have frequently seen in the past. It looks like a looks like a cursive letter E if I had to describe it but it morphs and changes into literally anything, feels immensely powerful, and it shows me CEVs that are mostly dark in nature. (Part of me thinks this is my shadow self) because it definitely feels like it is a part of me. I feel this way because I have done meditation on embracing my shadow self.

I am pissed at this point, I feel like my entity or “shadow self” is incredibly pissed at me. I then decide to put on a 3 hour healing meditation video. The entity starts to calm down and it is showing me that it is cloaking and drowning in this alcohol/poison and that it is also dying, just like my physical self. It tells me I have to quit, for real this time. It even gave me this sensation near my frontal lobe like it was tapping my forehead pretty hard saying get it through your thick, fucking skull! I then had the thought well what if I crave it like I usually do? The entity showed itself attacking the thought with incredible force. I felt it attacking the thought as a sensation in my brain. It told me that my life will improve and get better if I quit. It agreed to help me in doing so.

Then shit got even weirder. I have been having a sharp pain in the arch of my foot. It basically said we can fix this too. My entire foot, to my calf and hamstring completely locked up in a muscle spasm. It then told me I have to start stretching because my calves/hamstrings are tight and causing all the pain in my foot.

Was I actually interacting with my higher self, shadow self, ego, or some kind of entity? I would like to know if anyone has had a similar interaction.

I don’t regret the trip at all. I have thrown all my alcohol out and I don’t plan on drinking ever again.",t2_2tb6txdm,"Had a difficult trip yesterday, and I no longer want to drink alcohol.

Some parts taken from the article:

*""I never felt forced to consume alcohol,"" said Hussain. ""I never had a sip of alcohol on set. I don't drink. So that wasn't my experience. I've never felt like there was a shortage of food or water.""*

*He added, ""I never felt thirsty there. There were people who were hard at work making sure that when I was thirsty, and I said I wanted water, I got that water. There was no one telling me I couldn't sleep at a certain time. I could always just doze off. No one was telling me I need to wake up right now. We were pretty much free to do what we wanted. You know, alcohol was there. I never touched it. No one shoved it down my throat. Maybe some people had different experiences. It just wasn't my experience.""*

*""I think there's some people from the show that thought that they were going to get a lot more airtime than they actually did,"" Hussain told Primetimer. ""And I think some people are still shocked at the fact that they were just edited out completely without getting much screen time at all, or even just getting a line in that they didn't want.""*

*""So I think I think it comes from a place of — I don't know, maybe saltiness, maybe disappointment, maybe embarrassment,"" he continued. ""But you've got to be a certain type of individual to even agree to be on a reality TV show. You've got to know what comes with that territory.""*

*During their time on Love Is Blind, neither Hussain nor Hartwell matched with anyone, so viewers only saw them in the pods, and not in the real-world portion of the season.*

I haven’t drank since Sunday. I drank a lot in the past two weeks. Before that I was doing pretty well limiting my drinking. I’m going to do the 90 days of sobriety. 

I want to drink some fun beverages I was looking at r/mocktails. That might be a little bit too much for me. They use a lot of alcohol free alternatives that still have small amounts of alcohol and that might be a frustrating half buzz for me. I don’t know but I’m feeling cautious about it.

When we received them, I took a sip of mine and was taken aback because I thought I tasted alcohol but it was a spicy apple mocktail, so I took another sip to be sure it wasn't just a strong spice like anise or something. Still wasn't sure. My partner tasted his and said that he wasn't so sure his drink was spirit free, too. 

I looked over the menu that was still on our table just to see if there were similarly named cocktails, and lo and behold, the mocktails we ordered were versions of cocktails they offered and had very similar names. When the server came back to take our order, I asked if our drinks contained alcohol. She nodded and repeated our order back to us, but said the names of the cocktails. 

I said ""no, we ordered ________ and ________, the mocktail versions,"" started to get upset and finished my sentence with ""I'm here to celebrate my sobriety tonight and I'm being served alcohol?"" 

Her face fell and she apologized, and must have immediately told her manager the mistake because after sitting there for a few more moments trying to convince myself to enjoy the place, we got up to leave, and the manager rushed after me before I got to the door. 

She apologized, said she will edit the menu to detail what kind of glasses the mocktails are served in so it didn't happen again, comped the mocktails to go as well as our appetizer to go, and gave me a gift card. 

It was an honest mistake and they really were great about making it right; I especially appreciate that they will edit their menu. But a few days later, I'm still a bit sad and upset that it happened. I've gone so long actively making the choice to not drink alcohol and that autonomy was removed on a day that was supposed to be celebratory.

I went to a work party and got drunk, and rode my bike back home, and dropped it 3 times, the final time was when I got home and I literally fell off of it. It's a beautiful machine; a 2022 Royal Enfield Continental GT 650 in British racing green. Worked 80 hours a week for months to afford it and paid cash for it less than a month ago. It had less than 700 miles on it. I'm fine, and and other than breaking both levers off the bike really only suffered minor cosmetic damage that only I would know to look for. It's a beautiful thing I worked so hard for, and now it will forever be tainted by my inability to drink responsibly. It's all fixable, pricey but fixable, I've already bought most of the stuff to replace, but that's the least of my concerns. The next morning when I was assessing the damage the dealer tag was missing, meaning I rode it drunk with no licence plate. I was a giant neon sign riding down the highway that said ""Pull me over please!"".

The fact that I am not:

A. In jail rn

or

B. Dead in a ditch and/or in multiple pieces

I recently hosted a baby shower for a friend. This event was more of a bbq and celebrate, versus the tea party women only kind of shower.

The expectant mother came to me with a dilemma. Before her and her hubby started trying for a baby, they both were big party people. They were drinking every weekend and most Thursdays and other random weekdays, to where they both felt like they had an unhealthy relationship with alcohol. They also, like some people who drink a lot, would occasionally use “recreational drugs” when drinking and they both decided to quit. Not forever but for a long period of time. They made private personal goals about it that a few people knew but most friends and family didn’t. They almost had 6 months sober before the positive test. They weren’t trying yet, but they stopped preventing that month. They were going to actively try at their 1 year mark.

Well many of our friends are big drinkers, although I cut back myself since having kids. I only personally drink once or maybe twice a month if there’s an occasion. I don’t judge people who drink more, only if they drive. 

This baby shower most people drove solo or with their spouse. Only a few people have kids. The expectant mother said “everyone is planning on getting drunk and I’m really upset about it. I wish we could serve the fake alcohol, I tried a margarita made with fake tequila and and it tasted real. I was craving the taste.” I told her “this brand I know makes all sorts of booze, all alcohol free.” It was the brand she ironically tried the margarita with.

We decided to serve premade drinks and tell guests to only BYOBeer. The venue was a commercial venue but owned by my family so we told anyone that asked, no one could bring their own liquor. We made margaritas, rum punch, whiskey sours and vodka crans. All with fake liquor. 

People drank and some acted a fool. A few people brought beer but most people drank what was on offer. One person even hit another parked car. It was as if the drinks really had alcohol. It kind of defeated the purpose of what we did. 

Her husband ended up telling the person who hit the other car because that person tried to shift the blame to the couple “you guys over-served drinks” to get out of trouble for hitting the other car.

During this time, and without my knowledge, my roommate was using my computer to buy themselves frivolous things and completely drain my bank account without my knowledge. I just confronted them and they admitted to purchasing some things but not everything that is listed on my online banking. I told him that he is no longer allowed to use my money under any circumstances. He makes less than half than me on Ontario Works and I don't care if he starves at this point. He messaged me on the 3rd or 4th saying that he had not money left and was suspicious as to how he was surviving up until now, I got home a few days ago to an empty fridge and my suspicions only grew. Today I received an email from my bank that I only had $100 left in my account and that if it went under that I would be paying extra fines. Additionally, while I was away, he adopted a cat that has no shots and straight up attacks my cat, who is a very friendly creature. I tried separating them today and his cat attacked my face. I've now told him as well that his cat cannot leave the spare bedroom anymore. What can I do to get my money back and get this roommate out of my apartment?

EDIT: I have now informed the roommate that he is not welcome back, I have the key so he cannot get in, and informed him that when he is ready to come take what little things he has, he is free to. Unfortunately until then I will be taking care of a Hamster and an additional cat. I am cleaning up all of his things currently, when I am done, I will be calling the police, and on Monday I will be going to the bank to get another card and have my old one discontinued.

EDIT TWO: A Police Report has been filed and they will likely be here sometime today.

EDIT THREE: They are coming today to get their pets and ""some of their belongings.""

EDIT FOUR: Police have shown up and are going to speak to my roommate. They aren't hopeful to get anything from him but I did also call the bank and in 15 days I should be getting \~80% of what he stole back.

Rather, it’s a good chance to reflect on some of the key things that have helped me succeed in living a happy and productive life without alcohol. Without further ado…

1. Discard the label of “alcoholic.” 

I hate that word. Calling yourself an alcoholic ignores the root problem - that you’ve developed a dependence on a highly addictive substance, a substance that could do the same to anyone. When you say you’re an “alcoholic” you’re putting the blame on yourself, not on the substance that ensnared you.

2. Ignore what I heard in AA. 

Look, if AA works for you, congratulations! But after reading The Big Book and one year of attending AA meetings I can’t say that I learned anything that helped me, and heard a lot of stuff that I thought was counterproductive to facing the real problem. 

I found the works of Holly Whitaker and Annie Grace a much better way to get an understanding of alcohol dependency and approach living alcohol free.

3. Enjoy living free of alcohol!

I embrace and enjoy the fact I’m alcohol free. Once you start enjoying activities without alcohol you realize what a ball and chain feeling like you need to drink at every occasion actually is. 

So get out and live life!

Ever since then I try to avoid the mirror when tripping. 

But I'm happy to say I did stick to it and today is day 8 with no alcohol which is huuuge for me. 

Dropped a few tabs yesterday in  hopes it would maybe help me figure myself out a little more, which it didn't really in general but I did have a wonderful time and also had one of the best moments I've ever had with myself in the mirror. 

Tripping balls, I braved the mirror, looked deep into my own soul and said out loud, ""I'm proud of you."" And it was some of the most powerful words anyone's ever said to me and the craziest part is that it was me who said it to me. (🤯)

I can't remember the last time I was able to look at myself and feel pride in much of anything. So I guess as I'm writing this, I'm realizing this trip really did help me figure myself out a bit more than I thought it did. I have a long ass way to go to stay sober, but I hope as the days go on I can continue to march on and make myself proud.

They're constantly drinking, talking about drinking, socializing over drinking, hanging out at the bar. They can't ever seem to entertain a guest or hold a personal conversation without taking the edge off with some wine or rum or whatever. They sometimes even perform their duties with a glass in hand. Nursing a hangover while at their stations seems to be a common theme.

It just seems to me that they have no other personal or social interests to occupy their time. The moment they're off duty they hit the bottle. The moment a friend comes over they replicate/synthesize some more booze to share. They share drinking stories more than any other topic.

Maybe I'm just a prude? I dunno. Maybe I need to party more.

This morning my neighbor came to my house to drop some stuff, and invited me over for coffee. I already had taken one, so I was already hesitant, but she can be a bit insistent and I'm usually pretty attentive at following pregnancy diet indication, so I thought that once in a while drinking a second cup wouldn't hurt (I would still be considered in the limits, since I only drink a small amount at a time). While I started sipping the coffee I thought it tasted pretty funny, more bitter than usual, but I thought it was due to a different brand of coffee being used, or the different coffee maker, so I didn't say anything to not be rude. As soon as I was finished she told me she put rum in it. I was so shocked. Why would someone ever put rum in someone else's coffee without asking them first? And she knew I'm pregnant too.

This is so rude to do, and totally irresponsible. I started telling her that she shouldn't have put rum in the coffee and she got so offended! She said she only put a small amount, so she didn't do anything wrong. But why would you do it anyway? Small amount or not, pregnant or not, you don't put things in people food without telling them, it should be common sense.

I'm so mad. I know it probably didn't hurt the baby, but she still put her at risk for no reason at all. People are so inconsiderate. Sorry for the rant

EDIT: even if I'm still mad, I don't think it was done maliciously. We're not from USA, she's my mother's age and from eastern europe, where drinking in family settings is more common. I'm having a hard time explaining people that I can't drink, older friends and family are used to alcohol being suggested while pregnant or lactating, so I'm offered alcohol all the time, but it never happened that someone would just give it to me, even while not pregnant it's pretty rude. It's still a bad situation, but it's more linked to her not knowing new safety guidelines and being pretty rude, than actually malicious.

I was extremely social and had no problems speaking to or being around women and my concentration was absolutely phenomenal It was like my ADHD never existed in the first place. well.. this then lead me to become an alcoholic and everybody knew me as funny, very wise communicator, and I was just a total opposite of what I am today. Ever since I got sober now for some year's I became my old self again before alcohol which is very boring, difficult to concentrate, can't speak to women, and whole list of other things. My question is, is thier a supplement, herb, to make this trigger in the brain like alcohol does or what because that was the only time I actually enjoyed life",t2_8g38hqow,Why does alcohol make me normal?,t3_12keu6s,12keu6s,hkondabeatz,238,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/12keu6s/why_does_alcohol_make_me_normal/,0.95,216,alcohol,0.104435347020626,0.0961543023586273,0.145107626914978,0.0581351593136787,0.0973724424839019,0.3451277017593384,0.0436957292258739,0.0594931356608867,0.0274979993700981,0.0229805223643779,0.9828698039054871,0.017130183055996895

Since it was the end of the KY Derby folks were flowing out of local bars very well “lubricated”. One couple stood out as a fairly attractive blonde with very attractive tattoos walked angrily ahead of an equally attractive MF couple out of a popular bar. They turned out to be a unicorn and a married couple arguing over said unicorn making out with another couple during the Derby without consent of the couple that brought them to the event. Normally this could be discussed and normalized. But the threesome was waaay over the limit and ended up cussing each other out and storming off. So the takeaway for my wife and I going forward is: get lit or get laid. Never the two together. One or two drinks or puffs (it is Colorado after all) is fine but play with moderation in mind. Sort of sad to watch it happen so we thought we’d share.

Ok so basically my husband and I are getting married later this year. Each of our sides of the family are fairly big. It will be around 100-150 people total. My husband and I are paying for this all ourselves, as well as my grandma who said she doesn't care one way or the other on this issue. She just loves weddings.

We have a lot of kids in our family so we decided against making it child-free but we did decide to make it dry. So there will be no alcohol of any kind at our wedding. Honestly, this doesn't have anything to do with there being kids there but due to the fact that my fiancé and I don't drink. Nothing against people who do, it's just not for us and we don't want to. On top of that, we only really drink water. We rarely, if ever, drink soda so most of the time it's only water with the occasional juice and milk. We don't even drink coffee. 

So obviously the food (which is a part my grandma is not paying for) is going to be expensive for that many people. We are having our wedding catered so everyone will have a good choice of food to choose from but to drink only water will be provided. We don't want to have to pay for alcohol or soda, it is just an large added expense when we can just do filtered water for a MUCH cheaper cost.

Well, when family and friends found out being got angry. Some didn't really care but some are really upset about it. Saying that I can just have an open bar so I don't have to pay for drinks (we could, but still have to pay for the bartender and we just really don't want to bother with alcohol there). Or we should at least have soda because how can we expect everyone to drink ONLY water? The kids will be upset. The wedding will be boring. That this is not how weddings work. Etc.

So AITA? I didn't think this would be a problem! It's only water. I mean, don't most people drink water everyday anyway?

First off, thank you for the out pouring of support from the r/Construction community! I really didn't expect that and I'm glad y'll appreciated the sentiment. The crew seemed to as well. I hope everyone lets you use their bathroom and offers you food and snacks! I tried to get to many of you, but my ability to keep up trailed off after about mid-day today so my apologies to whomever I wasn't able to get too!

Second, it was a total hit! I ended up running to the store as soon as their opened this morning to pick up more stuff based on the comments last night. The final spread was an extra large case of waters, a case of Gatorade, a case of Minute Maid 0 Sugar Lemonade, two 20lbs bags of ice, 40 sandwiches (19 cubanitos, 20 without pickles or mayo per request of the comments haha), 16 cookies, and 2 bags of lays baked chips. I also set out plates, paper towels, and hand sanitizer. As you can see in the after photo, I'm left with 8 sandwiches, 7 waters, 3 cookies, and the lays chip bag with 3 chips haha. I'll call that a success!

(Edit) I should’ve gave more details on how we did this but I was too high. 

We’d go inside and sit at a table then look to see what coffee was there already then wait 10-20 minutes and take it. The coffee we took was not freshly made. Ex: if we took ice coffee the ice would be melted. That’s how long we waited

It’s Starbucks policy to remake drinks if the customer didn’t get there’s. And the employees knew what we was doing but they couldn’t say anything to the kids that was stealing because it’s against the policy. 

Stop arguing in my comments is annoying.

This is a relationship/friendship advice request really but I’d be so grateful for any help you guys can give!

One of my closest friends (F25) I met through my boyfriend (M29). She was the girlfriend of one of his work colleagues. They’re in the army. 

Last week she found out he’d been cheating on her for years despite them being engaged and making all sorts of large commitments financially and emotionally together (or seemed it anyway). Naturally, I’m so angry at the guy. He’s also been claiming she’s a psycho and telling these other girls all sorts of horrible things about my friend when it isn’t necessary in my eyes. I’ve tried to not get involved other than be there to support her.

Anyway, my boyfriend asked me to go with him for drinks at one of “the guys” houses and of course, the one who cheated will be there, with his new girlfriend. I’ve been asked by my boyfriend to not make it awkward. I don’t want to make it awkward, but morally, I don’t really want to talk to the bloke ever again. I can be polite but it seems like an uncomfortable situation. 

Do I go? If I do, do I tell my friend? I want to tell her and say I won’t be talking to him much and also won’t be passing information onto her about them as I don’t think it’ll help and don’t want to get too involved. Part of me just doesn’t want to go. Also a bit miffed that I’m the one being asked not to make things uncomfortable but I get that the guys work together. 
Please help, I’m so confused.

This lady is up there with the guy who went into a rage because his 1.5 inch thick steak, ordered well done, in the middle of a fully-packed lunch rush, was not on his table in 10 minutes. Some people seem to think that the laws of physical reality do not apply just because they're in a restaurant and I can't... I can't figure out what they think happens to make their food and drink appear on their table.

So. I had a this snooty elderly woman bring in a table of 18 one night. Pearls and expensive hair, designer skirt-suit, knew the owner blah blah blah.

No booking, demanded table service at a counter service bar. Fine, we were literally empty this Tuesday evening, so sure whatever. I'm the only staff in the place, because well, yeah, we are usually dead on a Tuesday.

I come to take drinks orders. She orders a G&amp;T.  Her entire table would not stop talking to each other, would not even acknowledge my presence when I asked if they wanted to order.

I say I'll get her drink come back in a moment. NO! She grabs my arm and holds me next to her, and insists I get eveyrone else's drink orders now. I go to politely interrupt the people next to her to get their drinks.

'No no *no*! Don't interrupt them! Get those people's orders over there!' She's still gripping my arm, literally holding me next to her. I speak to those people they ignore me too, won't stop chatting. She decides to interrupt them herself to get their order but she does the whole 'Oh Jane! DArling! How are you! How's the kids?...' and they have a whole catchup for several minutes before she asks them what they want to drink.

I manage to get four or five drink orders. Everyone else is still being ridiculous and I'm apparently not allowed to interrupt their conversation. I tell the lady I'm gonna get these drinks and come back. NO! She grabs my arm again.

I finally manage to get drinks orders for most the table. Then someone asks 'Wait what did you get? Wait I want to change my order, I want that!' and half of them spend another 5 minutes discussing the drinks and changing their orders while I try to get the last 3 people to FECKING ACKNOWLEDGE MY PRESENCE IF THEY  WANT A BLOODY DRINK which of course they do want after all.

It has taken fully 30 minutes at this table, held prisoner by the posh lady, to get this table's order. I mean I didn't have anything else to do, but jesus christ.

I finally confirm I have everyone's order and I will be back shortly with their drinks.

The lady looks down her nose at me - even though she's seated and I'm standing, some people can just do that look no matter what - and says snarkily, 'Now. *Dear*. I ordered a gin and tonic *quite some time ago* and I'm *still* waiting. Will that be coming soon, do you think \[snooty raised eyebrow\]?

I stare at her. I look at my arm, which she is still holding and has not let go of for 20 minutes. I look at my notepad. Which is clearly a physical paper notepad, not some ipad ordering whatever. There's not another soul in the place, there is literally no other staff nor has there been the entire time.

To this day, I can't fathom how she thought she was supposed to have her drink already served when she has not let me move from her side for half an hour since she ordered it.

istg some customers think they just have to Demand Things and that magically makes it happen without, yknow, like the laws of physics and reality or anything annoying like that.

&amp;#x200B;

\--

Little edit: Hey guys, gals, and enby pals, I appreciate all the support about how the lady shouldn't have touched me, but telling another server what they should have done to handle a situation doesn't necessarily come across like the solidarity you mean it to.  
  
I was 8 years deep in service jobs when this happened, I chose how to handle an annoying table. Their idiocy and irrationality bothered me far more than the old lady's clutchiness, and if I felt the need to address that at that time I would have been capable and comfortable to do so. I mention it purely because it shows that she cannot have been unaware that I was standing there the whole time, because she was touching me.",t2_atgsc8zo,Posh lady thinks drinks magically appear out of the ether without human intervention,t3_13ecfdw,13ecfdw,Left-Car6520,82,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/13ecfdw/posh_lady_thinks_drinks_magically_appear_out_of/,0.94,836,drinks,0.1766254603862762,0.0839894860982894,0.3469142019748688,0.0469035506248474,0.0902218073606491,0.1371245235204696,0.0216241367161273,0.0384271703660488,0.0371817536652088,0.0209879036992788,0.9285822510719299,0.07141777127981186

307,2023-03-13 10:22:39-05:00,1678720959.0,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,"This past weekend my wife (41F) I (42M) attended one of my friends party's that I was invited to. For context my friend (42M) his gf (48F) and their two friends (also mid 40's M&amp;F) were hosting this party the **4 of them together.**

A few weeks ago when I received the invitation I realized that it said on it something along the lines of ""please be prepared to purchase your own drinks"". Didn't think much of it at the time considering I just thought they were hiring a bar tender or something, but fast forward to the day of the party.

I arrive with my wife and it's my friend and his gf standing behind their kitchen counter that they were using as their ""bar"", making/charging the guests for drinks. Now I was confused for a few reasons...

1, the fact that this party was held at my friends house, it's not like this was at an event space or something where this would be normal imo. 2, there was no bar tender that they hired or anything like that. It was literally 2 of the 4 of them standing in the kitchen at a time making drinks for people and then charging them accordingly (drinks were all under $10).

Now idk if this is actually a common thing, but I have never in my 42 years of living been to a ""party"" at a friends house where the hosts are charging you themselves for drinks.

I've had multiple parties over the years, that I have invited my friend and his gf to in which they have attended, and I've never charged **ANYONE** for drinks ever. I've always bought all the drinks myself and had an open bar type of situation. Where my guests can make there own drinks. I even had a proper bar tender once and still no one was charged, it was an open bar.

I honestly felt like my friend, his gf and their friends were all trying to make a quick buck off of their guests who attended. Clearly to cover to cost of the drinks. Which yeah I understand that booze isn't cheap these days but we're talking splitting the cost of whatever they bought between **4 PEOPLE**. Like in my opinion if you can't afford to supply drinks at your party, why are you having a party in the first place?

This also wasn't for charity or anything the money made off of the drinks was for them to split.

My wife and I bought one drink each, stayed for about an hour or so, and said our goodbyes. When we were leaving my friend asked why we didn't have that much to drink? I told him because I think it's ridiculous that they are charging their close friends for drinks. He called me cheap and an unsupportive friend. I assured him that i'm not, if the charging of drinks was for a good cause (like profits go to charity or something) of course i'd buy drinks.

I told him I find the fact that they are charging for drinks, and keeping the money for themselves ridiculous and taking advantage of their friends. Anyway now my friend and his gf are butt hurt about this and have been calling me an AH to our mutual friends. AITA here?

(EDIT: Wow! I did not expect this post to blow up like this but thank you guys.

For any of those wondering, after reading these comments my wife and I have decided to exclude my ""friend"" and his gf from any of our future parties.

309,2023-04-09 13:37:19-05:00,1681065439.0,RBI,t5_2tayf,"So really I just cannot piece together how this has happened. 

I was in my hometown, on a casual night out with friends, and after we parted ways I have a period of absolutely no memory and all of my bank accounts (business, personal and savings with two separate banks) have had all the money taken out. There are ATM withdrawals from two accounts at about 4am and these were the two accounts I had bank cards on my person for. So I initially thought perhaps I'd had a card cloned whilst I was out but I was only using one of them so it makes no sense how they could have both been copied and used successfully.

It gets a lot worse however. After taking the max possible out via ATM there is a further £2,000 spent in a currency exchange and another £1,500 in what shows in my banking app as a restaurant, though not somewhere I can find any information on.

To use my cards in the machines they'd need my PIN. They could have seen me entering this whilst I was out but I'm completely at a loss as to how they'd get the PIN for both cards when I was only using one.

Worse yet, there was a transfer made from a completely separate bank account of mine, into the current account I had the card for. This can only have been made via the app on my phone which is authorised using my fingerprint. So the crooks topped up the account they had the cards for, with more of my money, which they then stole.

So there's three separate accounts they've been able to access somehow and I've also been getting texts and emails about loan applications made in my name. 

This means they've had access to my phone, my bank accounts and my email. But how could they have got all of this?

I've blocked all my accounts, not that there's anything left to take from them, and frankly the bank aren't being very helpful. The police were a little more interested and have taken a full statement and pledged to look at CCTV from the various places cash has been taken out and spent.

However I'm still concerned this isn't over because I can't see any way they could do this without my phone being compromised and I haven't worked out how this has happened. 

Fairly sure I must have been spiked to have this 6-8 hour blackout window, but does that mean they've just used my finger whilst I was passed out to keep unlocking my phone and authorise the transactions they've made? Because I've still got my phone, and my cards, so why wouldn't they have just kept these, or disposed of them?

In a further twist of curiosity both my main banking apps on my phone had disappeared from the folder they sit in. The apps were still on my phone but had been moved, either in a failed attempt to uninstall them or it could be that these aren't the legit apps and are some kind of clones that were installed in place of the originals.

So, can anyone piece together any suggestions as to how this has all been carried out? Is it possible there's some kind of phone cloning going on or is it more likely I've just been drugged and they've managed to get everything they need from my phone whilst I was out of it? 

I realise now how vulnerable it is having all your banking on your phone and all of this accessed with your fingerprint. If it had needed a PIN or unlock pattern surely there's no way they could have got in?

Obviously I feel completely awful for letting myself get scammed so badly and I'm not holding out any hope that there's any way to get any of the money back, which was literally everything I own. I just really wish I could get a better understanding of how this has happened to me.

Is this a targeted attack or just opportunistic and I've just been very unlucky? What could the mystery £1,500 payment be for?

This is sort of indicative of his attitude towards normal people, which is one of general contempt. He sees them as incompetent and beneath him. This attitude can be seen in the first episode, and in the episode where he goes for management training.

Shiv: Asks if she dares order their house red, and then comments that their nozzles are tainted. Shiv doesn’t demonstrate the same contempt for average people that Roman does, but instead is more contemptuous of their means (their wine and nozzles aren’t good). Plays into her nature as someone who doesn’t look down on average people and generally wants to help them (based on her more liberal politics) but doesn’t really want to associate with them at all.

Connor: Asks for what an “average joe” would drink, but then names a specific fancy beer brand. Generally showing how confused and out-of-touch he is.

Kendall: Actually acts and orders drinks like a normal person (including knowing that the bartender can make a vodka tonic). I think out of all the siblings, Kendall interacts and is comfortable around average people the most (such as when he goes to the bar in season 1, or when he gets high with a bunch of meth-heads).

Also funny note that the siblings are all dressed super-rich, while Kendall actually could pass as a normal guy.

Two large filtered waters are required to get the thirst bar from 0 to maximum (i.e., to prevent a net loss of water).  Each large filtered water is about 425 ml.  Thus, Ryley must drink 25.75 ml a minute, which amounts to 1.545 liters an hour.  Over relatively short periods, adult humans can survive up to about 1.9 L of water per hour, BUT the long term excretion rate for human kidneys is only 800 - 1,000 milliliters (0.8-1 liter) of water per hour.  It's very rare for humans to exced 1 L of water consumption per hour over sustained periods, as this level of water consumption is extremely unpleasant.  Thus, most cases of water intoxication occur with single massive doses of water.  But in Ryley's case, he's choking down extroardinary amounts of water for days or weeks.  This guy is literally pushing himself beyond maximum kidney excretion levels day and night -- often with little or no sleep.

323,2023-04-17 09:13:01-05:00,1681740781.0,entitledparents,t5_358dh,"So I was pondering posting this on AITA because of my response, but decided this may be the better place to post. 

A little backstory. I am 21. And live with my parents as the economy right now is insane and finding a place to live without being unable to still buy food and water is near impossible where I live. Now for the actual story. 

My mother is the type to feel entitled to anything in the house, and I'm living with her, and despite the items having been bought with my money, it's still under her roof. Back in September of last year, I bought a mini fridge for my bedroom. I buy my own foods and drinks as they're better for my diet than the foods my parents buy. Not to mention, my mother always tells me to pay her back for any food of theirs that I eat, so I just buy my own stuff and get it over with. I hadn't had any issue with anyone trying to take my food or drinks since I got it, so I never thought of precautions. Until a couple weeks ago. I'd bought a small cheesecake from the grocery store as I'd been craving it and I had the money to be able to get it. I also got myself a pack of sodas to have here and there. I'd left home to work, and didn't think I'd have any worries. 

After getting home from a long day, I planned to shower and sit down with my treat and a nice movie. But when I looked in the fridge to grab a water, the cheesecake and 4 sodas were missing. I asked my fiance if she had eaten or drank any of it, and she said she'd taken herself a long shower and napped all day as her day beforehand had been exhausting to say the least. So I checked the family fridge and what do i find? My missing cheesecake and sodas. I grabbed all of them and placed them back in my fridge before asking around to see who took it. My brother was in school all day and my dad had apparently taken up an extra shift at work, so that left my mother. But when I asked her, she acted offended that I'd accuse her of theft. I decided to leave it alone. It was safely back with me, and I planned to share the treat with my fiance and drink a soda and just leave it behind me. 

The next day, my mother bursts into my room screaming at me for stealing from her. I had just woken up and wasn't fully registering what was happening. My fiance, however, was still asleep and the noise woke her up in a panic. I asked what this was all about, and she screamed at me about the cheesecake and sodas, and how it was expensive to get and how dare I take that away? She was planning to eat it that night with my dad and watch movies with him as it was his first few days off in a week. Instead of being angry, I actually started laughing. This wasn't the first time she'd accused me of stealing from her after she took from me. This did not go over well with mother, and she screeched again about giving it back. I laughed harder and had to catch my breath. I told her I'd bought them, and we had eaten the cheesecake the night prior and I'm keeping MY sodas. She screamed that I better pay her back for the things that I stole from her. And that next time she buys things she's keeping count of exactly how much she has so she knows when I steal again. 

I then stood up and opened my bag, where I had the receipt from when I bought the items. I shoved it in her face. I told her I'd bought them as a little treat for myself for working so much and that she wasn't getting ANY of it. And then I had the best idea. I told her I was going to get ANOTHER cheesecake, because I had some cash that could pay for it and she wasn't getting any of that one either. Then I turned to my fiance and told her to grab my phone and see how much a fridge lock would cost. My mother turned me around forcefully and slapped me for trying to put a lock on my fridge. I'm in her house. And I don't have permission. So I reminded her that her house or not, it was MY fridge. I paid for it. And I can lock it if I want. My fiance told me I could get a fridge lock online for cheap and it'd be delivered in 2 days. So I ordered it right in front of my mother. And then told her since I didn't have to work for a couple days, I'd be keeping an eye on all my things. 

She stomped out of the room in a fit of rage and screeched to my dad about what a disrespectful daughter I am, and how dare I speak to her this way. I laughed about it pretty much every day since then, and when the lock came in, I put it on my fridge immediately. And, everywhere I go, whether I'm going to work or even to the bathroom, the keys go with me, unless my fiance is staying home. In which case she keeps the keys. 

Nice try mom!

Edit: for all of you telling me to get over myself and move out, I actually cannot. A one bedroom apartment around anywhere in my state, is about $1500 a month, not including bills and expenses, including my medical bills, as unfortunately i have a good number of medical issues that need attention. That adds up (roughly) to about $2500 a month, if not more. And my fiance and i cannot afford that along with food. I'm stuck here until I'm finished with my degree and can get a job offer.

Edit 2: I'm getting a lot of comments saying I sound entitled. While I respect your opinion, there was an agreement made back when I was 16 that any food they bought was theirs, and any food I bought was mine. No exceptions. I do buy them things from time to time just to be nice. However, they do not pay for ANYTHING for me. Anything and everything I have I paid for. The only real help I get from them is my dad helps me fix my car from time to time, and even then I do most of the fixing and pay for any and all parts i may need. I also use my own gas and car to drop off and pick up my little brother from school when my dad is at work all week as my mother does not want to.

BUT the espressos that come out are acidic. I never taste the “sweet” sugars people talk about… or perhaps it’s overwhelmed by the acidity. Mind you the shots are not sour by any means, not on d I dial them in — but they’re acidic and sharp. 

I’ve gone to the best coffee shops in my area, and find their shots tasting similar. 

I’m essentially convinced that the sweetness and fruity flavors people talk about are not the same flavors I think of when I hear those terms.

Interestingly, when i have the same shots as a latte, I love them. A smooth, tad bitter, complex taste. No acidity. That’s what I’m here for — and don’t really understand how anyone can enjoy straight espresso.

I fully understand the need to hydrate better and the importance of water. The challenge is, I really dislike the taste of water, and as a result, I'm not disciplined enough to drink it as I should - even when I set reminders and keep a glass with me all day.

I don't mind Gatorade or Powerade-type drinks but also understand if those serve as my primary source of hydration that's a lot of sugar. This leads to my next challenge: I dislike the taste of 'sugar alternatives' more than plain water (I'm pretty sure I've tried them all).

A friend of mine achieved an important milestone in her life a week back. She invited some of her friends and me to celebrate in a restaurant with a bar. I'm a teetotaller, non-smoker who doesn't care about others drinking. Now, post dinner, these guys were getting some beers and scotches. They asked if I wanted one as well. I refused and said that I don't drink.

Now these guys were all over me with stuff like ""bro how can you have fun if you don't drink"" and stuff like ""drinks allow you to loosen up bro"" and stuff. Dei unakku kudikaran aganum na nee agikko. Enna sekadha.

What is up with all these people, including 16Y/O thinking it's cool to drink and smoke? Dei pasangala, kudikanum na nee mattum kudi. Thevayillama enna izhukadha.

I walked inside the store to pick it up but it was still being made. I watched the barista pour 2% into a shaken espresso so I assumed it couldn’t be mine. Then she called out my name. I had to ask “… did you put 2% in this ?” And she said “yeah why, do you not want 2%?”. I explained to her that it’s supposed to be oatmilk, and to not come off as rude I said “I work at Starbucks too so I understand mix-ups sometimes”. But I wonder how often this happens here.

I dont work for the night, the people who run the night saw the post independently and didn't know it was me who posted at first! I saw loads of people wanting to come and was all of a sudden very conscious that there is in fact finite space in the room so didn't want to reply to everyone telling them to come only for there not to be any room! In the end two people from Reddit came and I was very grateful for it! I like to think I did well in my set, I didnt deliver everything perfectly but it wasnt a bomb by any means! Riffed quite a few things too, not all the riffing landed but thats showbiz baby. Will post the video once I get sent it. It was a really good night in the end! I have been very hungover today and busy at work so sorry for the radio silence. I will take some time on Friday to respond to individual peoples messages/questions. For the record, there's a buzzing open mic scene in London and I'd be more than happy to recommend some of them if people want something to do on a weekday or weekend! 

Edit: obligatory ""Holy shit this blew up"" post. I did not expect such a massive response! You are all massive legends and I simply haven't had time to respond to people as i have a job (the subject of my set). I'll stay true to my word and buy all redditors a drink, but I would just note that there is a capacity limit on the venue! I bought four tickets for people, which includes a drink each, but on top of that if its sold out I have no idea how this shit works. Ive done the night before and there is a decent amount of space, so try to get down before 7.30 to guarantee a space? I'll be wearing a beige peacoat, im 6'0, white with brown hair and clean-shaven with a posh accent lol. 

Edit: i believe i have found someone, but do feel free to come along anyway if you want something to do! Thanks for all the responses, much appreciated!

As the title says, im an amateur stand up comic and i have a slot booked in for tonight, 7.30-10, at a night in Camden called Comedy In Your Eye. Its one of my favourite open mics due to the quality of the comedians generally being quite high. They get genuine audience but like many/most open mics, they make you bring an audience if you want to perform, which makes sense. 

My ""bringer"" (the term for a person you have to bring in order to perform) cancelled on me this morning, I am willing to pay someone 40 quid cash or transfer + buy drinks in exchange for you simply attending it with me as an audience member. Ideally you'd laugh at the acts' jokes if you find them funny too. Its also a fun way to meet people! 

So, if you're interested, its at the Camden Eye, right by Camden Town tube Station,  it starts at 7.30.

\- What's the tastiest drink you've had on playa? Or the not-tastiest, but the one you have the best memories associated lol

I’ve always wondered why the business model in the US has gone seemingly overboard with customizations. It causes so much stress on workers and seems really unnecessary to customize a drink to the extent that people customize it in the US. 

In S. Korea the only thing you can change is the milk in the drink or make it decaf and that’s it. It’s not impossible to “ask” for something changed but people will look at you like you have 5 heads. As culturally, asking for a change on a menu item is kind of unheard of and you just order what is available on the menu in front of you the way it is. 

I think about the way Starbucks run here and it makes me sad for the workers in the Starbucks US. It’s stressful and inefficient. Do you think customizations should be limited?

me and my partner came into a substantial amount of money from a horrible event that happened before i met him, so we used that money to pay for the wedding after we paid off all my debts and braught essentials for the house and kids.

my 2 sisters (27f) we will call sarah and (25f) we will call ann, sarah and ann are really close to eachother but not so much to me, well they didnt know about the money till recently because i got bombarded with questions on how i was affording all this,  so i eventally gave in and explained to them but now sarah keeps asking to lend money off me or if i can by her things as she dosnt have as much money as i do and wants to buy her kids things like i do with mine but i kept telling her no but she kept saying that im being selfish and that she deserves atleast some of it because ""at the end of the day shes my sister"" ,

so when i put my foot down and cut her off from contacting me she went for my partner so i uninvited her to the wedding, if she cant respect me or my partner then i dont want her there.

as a responce to this ann stated that i should atleast pay sarahs debts off before paying for the wedding as sarah is stuggling quite alot but does not work.

during all of this i sent out all of the invitations that said on it ""the bar is cash only so everyone will need to withdraw the money beforehand"" (as the closest atm is quite far from the venue) everyone sent their rsvp with now issues till i read anns,   hers said ""i will be coming but YOU will need about 300 out for my drinks"" 

i rang her staright away asking her what she meant and her responce was ""if you want me there then i am NOT paying for my drinks it is your choice to get married so you can pay for my drinks and meal, it isnt like you cant afford to anyway"" she also added that i need to pay for her drinks and meal at my bachelorette 

i politley explained to her that it is my money, ive paid for her bridesmaid dress and for her to get her nails done, her hair done and that she should be willing to attend just because im her sister and i should not be expected to pay for her own drinks as tap water is free if is refusing to pay for them,

she went to sarah and my mum to complain about it and now im being called an asshole for wanting my sister to be there for free knowing i have all this money",t2_w83o8vcb,AITA for expecting my sister to pay for her OWN drinks at my bachelorette and at my wedding,t3_137n74z,137n74z,luckycharm2005,63,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/137n74z/aita_for_expecting_my_sister_to_pay_for_her_own/,0.86,130,drinks,0.0324933119118213,0.0072974581271409,0.0523248165845871,0.0071131284348666,0.0476031564176082,0.021754402667284,0.0041938573122024,0.0051953508518636,0.8184515237808228,0.0035729582887142,0.9797348380088806,0.020265202969312668
402,2023-04-02 19:26:29-05:00,1680481589.0,AmItheAsshole,t5_2xhvq,"This is an incredibly ignorant argument to me but I genuinely need to know if I'm wrong here. I got together with my husband 6 years ago. I had a 1yo son and he had a 4yo daughter. Both of us had full custody. We admittedly blended our families super quickly but it was never an issue for anyone involved and it worked out quite nicely. My son is now almost 7 and his daughter is almost 11. 

The issue arose as of recently because my husband made a rule years ago that there was only one drink before bed and never throughout the night due to both kids having accidents. I had no issue with this. It was even recommended by the doctor. The issue however is that he is now allowing his daughter to have multiple drinks throughout the night and is still telling my son he can't have one. Neither kids have had accidents for quite awhile but he fully stuck by this rule until maybe 6 months ago but only with my kid.

This thoroughly pisses me off and I have multiple reasons for it. For one, my son has asthma and his throat/mouth get dry often due to his inhaler. For two, he also sweats way more than I would ever think possible for any child and again, this makes him incredibly thirsty. His daughter has no issues. She simply can't sleep so she gets up to get a drink or she hears us talking in the kitchen and makes excuses to come out ""for a drink"" but just sits there and tries starting conversations with us. She also pounds easily 2 cups every single time she does this so she is up and down no less than 5 times a night to use the bathroom. So, when she just came out to the kitchen to grab a drink, I told her no. Reason being was because my son had just asked for one not even 15 minutes prior and was told no by my husband. My husband asked why she couldn't and I told him (AGAIN, as I've mentioned it multiple times) that I'm tired of him allowing her special drink treatment when my son who has actual reasons for needing drinks is told no constantly. He got pissed and got my son a drink and brought it in to him. He comes back out and says ""There, happy?"" So I said ""That's a start"". However he is now pulling the cold shoulder and very obviously pissed off at me. AITA?

ETA: I said it already in my post but some people aren't seeing it.. I HAVE spoken to him several times about the water issue and long before this year alone. I started raising this point over 3 years ago but truly started pushing it when he started allowing his kid drinks throughout the night but not mine. I couldn't raise the issue anymore than I already have. Both kids got a drink. I told my step daughter no but gave her one after he gave my son one.",t2_8fe22zqqy,"AITA for ""picking a fight"" over my step daughter getting extra drinks throughout the night?",t3_12a3ogk,12a3ogk,ChemicalNo3495,302,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12a3ogk/aita_for_picking_a_fight_over_my_step_daughter/,0.91,580,drinks,0.0803675651550293,0.0177916139364242,0.0597283281385898,0.0123643837869167,0.0342095755040645,0.0672130435705185,0.0083159189671278,0.0081101153045892,0.7027730345726013,0.0091263772919774,0.97942054271698,0.020579446107149124

She has never liked casual drinks and she only ever wants to go for drinks at a pub, so weekends are still basically shitfaced or nothing. When we are out its so difficult to get her to leave once shes started drinking, unless the place is literally closing and we're being kicked out. Most weekends she drinks until she throws up and is then in bed all-day   the next day.

I've always liked going on the piss and I still love doing that with my mates (which is only occasionally now because that's life). However, when I'm with my partner now I'd prefer to have just casual drinks.

I guess where I'm at atm is I'm now feeling that drinking with my partner isn't fun anymore, and the evening really isn't worth the hangover. If we do go out for drinks I literally have to wait until she's  done because it wouldnt feel right to just leave her there, so it normally ends with me just waiting for her to: a) decide she's finished which is rare, b) the place thankfully closes (in which case she's looking for somewhere else or trying to buy cans to drink at home), or c) she is that drunk after being sick in the toilets she needs to be brought home.

Maybe I've become boring at 30, or has anyone else got to this point? How do you go about dealing with this situation?

EDIT: Wow, this really blew up. Thanks for all the replies. It's taken a while to read through them all, but there seems to be a general consensus. I must say, though, it's not a drinking everyday situation, but it is every time we do drink situation (I.e. weekends). 

I actually do voice it all the time to her that I'm done with the same thing every weekend, but i guess i let it go again until the next time it happens. I think it's about time that a real sit-down chat is needed. Thanks all x",t2_w81mb412,My GF (29F) still drinks like we did in Uni.

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ubfdx/aita_for_throwing_my_brothers_alcoholism_back_in/)**: April 21, 2023**

For context: I (20F) in the US where the drinking age is 21.

Both of my parents died by the time I was 10. My older brother, Charlie (then 19, now 29), ghosted. He was an alcoholic and felt it was all too much. It’s a choice I now understand as an adult, but as a kid, of course it hurt. I was raised by both my grandmother and older sister, Renee (then 17, now 27). My grandmother did all she could, but she was older and relied on Renee a lot.

When I was 17, Charlie came back into our lives, 2 years sober. Renee and I forgave him. I am now very close to him and we’ve bonded a lot. I actually live with him now while I go to college because he lives literally right up the road.

I do party on occasion, but it’s very rare I get drunk. Now, I always assumed that Charlie knew I drank. I’m in college. Not every college student parties, but when I’m at out past midnight, I figure it’s obvious I’m not playing Scrabble or whatever.

I crashed at a friend’s on Wednesday night after having a bit too much to drink. I returned to Charlie’s, hungover. It wasn’t quite obvious at first but then I started throwing up. He figured it out and began lecturing me. Said I’m 20, not legally able to drink, it’s not safe to get wasted at a college party. Told me that I shouldn’t drink at all at my age. He wasn’t yelling, more matter of fact than anything.

I wasn’t feeling great, had a headache and found his rant hypocritical. I told him such. He started drinking at 15, had a huge problem at 19. He abandoned our family when we needed him most. He has no right to judge me or act like a protective big brother now. Charlie got quiet, walked out of the room and later left for work. He hasn’t said much to me since. He’s definitely not mad, just sad and hurt.

Renee told me I crossed a line. While she’s fine with me drinking and thinks Charlie overreacted a little, she said I went way too far in throwing back all that in his face. Especially as I’ve never brought it up before. She says the most I should’ve said was that I was safe while drinking and I understood his concern, but I could do what I wanted as an adult.

I’m starting to feel bad. Was I wrong?

***Relevant Comments:***

*Someone points out brother may have been worried for her safety:*

""I didn’t consider that he was worried about me being vulnerable around guys. I just thought he was talking about driving, which I didn’t do. I walked to a friend’s dorm.""

*You share a genetic predisposition for alcoholism:* 

""While I don’t think I have a problem, our mom was a heroin addict and it contributed to her death. Her mom was an alcoholic. Pretty sure her sister was too. So, it is genetic. Doesn’t mean I have it, but the commenter and my brother aren’t wrong to be concerned, I’m learning.""

""Yeah, I didn’t know much about the genetic part but when you said it and I look at our family history…you’re not far off. I don’t think I have a problem but it certainly is genetic in our family.""

*Many people point out just how much OOP overreacted:* 

""You’re absolutely right. I’m definitely becoming embarrassed.""

*It wasn't your brother's responsibility to care for you:*

""I don’t think he had a responsibility to take care of anyone. I do think he had a responsibility to just not up and leave. So maybe people are right. Maybe I am not really over it.""

""I’ve thought about therapy a lot. I guess it’s time to think about it more.""

**Update (Same Post): April 22, 2023 (Next Day)**

Update: First of all, thank you for being so honest with me. A lot of it was very hard to read and I didn’t want to accept it, but I know I needed to.

I still do not think I have a drinking problem. I know that’s what every alcoholic says, but I truly do not get as drunk as I did that often. At the same time, I recgonize addiction is genetic and Charlie is not the only person in our family that struggles with it. Considering that, I am going to take a break from drinking for a little while and if/when I start again in the future (after I turn 21 at a minimum), I will be more careful when it comes to how much I consume and the venue in which I consume it.

A lot of you pointed out that Charlie was right about the safety concern. I was getting wasted at a college party. I didn’t include this in the post, which is unfair looking back as it’s important context, but none of my friends were sober either. So, I had no one looking out for me nor was I looking out for myself. I see now all the things that could’ve happened.

The big takeaway is that I am not “okay” or “over” with what happened. I buried it down because I just wanted a relationship with my brother again and then as soon as I was reminded of that time, I lashed out. I plan to look into finding a therapist because clearly, there’s a lot of unresolved issues.

Finally, I knew early on after posting that I owed Charlie an apology. I ordered dinner for us last night and apologized. I said I understood that he was concerned and he had every right to be. I also said I had no right to throw everything back in his face. Charlie apologized for everything he put the family through, but I told him that he already had. He repeated that he was just very worried about me turning into him. I thanked him for his concern and told him I’m grateful for him, I love him.

I am not foolish to think everything is okay. He knows now that I’m struggling with everything. I also can’t take back the words I said or what a brat I was. But we’re going to try moving forward and find healing.

Michigan - Fried Eggs

Honestly pretty good, but if you leave them in the ~~locker room tunnel~~ frying pan too long, bad things happen. Pretty expected if you ask me, given eggs are products of a nervous bird.

Michigan State - Huevos Rancheros

The first time I had huevos rancheros, it was absolutely delicious. Every time since, it’s kinda sucked, and the restaurant doesn’t make it the same. At least I didn’t give the cook $95 million.

Rutgers - Apples

Looking past Rutgers’ grassroots connection to the Big Apple, the fruit is arguably the first food. That said, people aren’t really sure if apples are a breakfast food specifically, and they kinda suck.

Maryland - Littlebites Muffins

When you see them in the aisle while shopping, you get excited so you buy them. Get in the car, open up the bag, and the first few taste good. They get old fast, and other muffin after the first 2-3 sucks. Folks, I just described nearly every Terrapin football season for what feels like the last 50 years. Building excitement in the offseason, shows out the first few games, and flops in conference play.

Ohio State - French Toast

All around elite. There is definitely some variance in French toast quality, but even bad versions are always pretty good, just like Buckeye seasons - a bad year for them is 11-2 with a Rose Bowl.

Penn State - Biscuit

Always consistently really good, but never great. It’s not a main course, meaning it will always struggle with the big boys of the breakfast world (read: French Toast), but so many other breakfast foods would kill to be as tasty as biscuits.

Indiana - Rice Krispie Cereal

No taste, no identity. Truly terrible. Literally just a holdover until ~~basketball season~~ lunch. Plus, and I say this as a son of an IU grad: Bloomington sucks. Sorry Hoosiers.

WEST

Purdue - Bagel

Bagels are always ok. Never really seem that bad, but aren’t ever really that great either. Even better when you mix a nice spread ~~offense~~ in. ^(God, it’s taking everything in my power to not make a FDU joke.)

Northwestern - Greek Yogurt

All of these health nerds say that greek yogurt is good for you, building probiotics and the whatnot. I should probably listen to what they have to say, but I don’t. Pat Fitzgerald is cool.

Illinois - Fruit Salad

Honestly pretty meh. You want to pick around the bad bits and only eat the good bits, but fruit salad’s only claim to fame is that it’s better (and cheaper) than ~~Northwestern~~ Greek yogurt.

Minnesota - Oatmeal

Solid, but has met its obvious ceiling. It’s definitely better than some of the other breakfast foods on this list, but is squarely mediocre.

Nebraska - Corn Flakes

It’s too obvious, isn’t it? Used to be a lot better a long time ago. Then ~~Scott~~ Frosted Flakes came back, and we thought they would be better, and they aren’t. Plus the corn.

Iowa - Cheerios

No, not the honey ones, just the regular ones. Boring, bland, underwhelming, but they get the job done. Plus, Brian Ferentz looks a little like the Bee, even though he doesn’t make honey.

Wisconsin - Breakfast Beer

I’ve only met one Wisconsinite in my life, and I don’t even know if she was a Badger fan, but holy hell did she drink like a fish. I don’t know what y’all do up there, but your livers have industrial capacity. Unbelievable.

UCLA and USC don’t count here because while everyone else in the B1G is up eating breakfast, they’re on West Coast time, still sleeping.

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hello friends, it’s great to be here with you not drinking on this Monday! It was honestly incredible to read everyone’s supportive comments to each other yesterday. You are all amazing. A high five to all the high fives! 

Today, I wanna talk about **triggers**. Gross. But learning about my triggers and how to plan / cope is something that really helped me.

My triggers fall into a few categories: bad times, good times, and habits. I’d start off most days thinking that I wouldn’t drink. Then 5pm would roll around (the dreaded witching hour!) and I’d lose my resolve. Just one wouldn’t hurt right? (Yeah, we all know where that is heading…)

When I started this streak, I decided to make a plan ahead of each trigger. This was helpful for habits and good time triggers. I also set out to learn new coping tools for the bad times that I couldn’t plan for.  A good plan helps but there’s always something out of your control, so I think about plans as my starting point - then try to be flexible as real life unfolds.

For me, planning for a trigger could look like:
* completely mixing up my routine for the first month so I wouldn’t have the 5PM witching hour at home alone
* making sure the house is stocked up with food / non-alcoholic drinks
* looking at the menu for bars / restaurants ahead of time so I have a plan for what I’d drink (and deciding on my back-up option if nothing is worth it: soda water or water). I do want to go back to the days of just having tap water at restaurants exclusively though to save money, lol.
* making a list of fun activities to do around the city for free/ low cost 
* scheduling time with friends and family

How about you - Has planning for triggers helped you in the past, or what do you find most helpful for dealing with triggers?

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hey friends, it’s Thursday! Thanks everyone for sharing your fav NA drinks yesterday. The ones I can’t wait to try are sparkling water with fruit juice added (wow game changer), adding a lil hot sauce to drinks (!!), and fruit shrubs (I still don’t really know what these are but it sounds good!).

Today, I wanna talk about **REST and relaxing**. Learning to relax again has brought me a lot of joy and relief in recovery.

I am also a recovering perfectionist. I had a terrible time saying no to things and an even worse time setting unrealistic goals and expectations for myself. Wine was a way to slow my brain completely down to nothing and shut off for the night. My problematic drinking really started at a period when I burnt myself out from work.

When I started therapy, I told my therapist that I couldn’t relax. I dreaded evenings at home alone because I didn’t want to drink and I didn’t enjoy any of the typical home relax activities. 

I later found out that alcohol increases anxiety after 15 minutes or so. So that ‘relaxing’ glass of wine was making it impossible for me to relax. Whilst I blamed myself for not being able to relax, alcohol was creating both the problem and the need for it as a solution.

These last few months, I’ve rediscovered that I can relax. WHO KNEW.  It is such a relief to be able to find joy and comfort in chilling again. My anxiety is soo much better.
 
One surprising thing that my therapist taught me was that rest looks different for every person. I might not enjoy vegging out watching TV all night, and that’s totally cool (also totally cool for anyone who does enjoy that). My rest might look more like watching a specific movie, reading a book, playing guitar, going for a walk, cooking, etc. It helped me to learn that rest is very individual and that I shouldn’t have a specific expectation about resting for myself. 

Making sure I have enough rest time is still a WIP but it’s been cool to see progress on my anxiety, being able to relax, and setting boundaries.

Today I’d love to hear: What does rest look like for you - how do you like to relax when you’re not drinking ?

Hey friends, I’m glad that we are all here on this Wednesday, whatever time is it where you are in the world. 

Today, I wanna talk about **non-alcoholic beverages**. Not specifically the non-alcoholic versions of alcoholic drinks. Instead, the whole WORLD of drinks out there that don’t contain any alcohol! (including good old water!)

When I was drinking, I thought it was such a waste of calories to drink anything that wasn’t water, coffee, or alcohol. I never paid attention to any non-alcoholic options. I even remember wondering what the hype was behind this popular new seltzer, if there wasn’t any booze in it? (Looking back in hindsight… lol).

Since I stopped drinking, I’ve discovered that there’s a ridiculous amount of drinks that don’t have alcohol?! And they taste AMAZING?!  

For me, having a delicious non-alcoholic drink relieves a lot of the cravings. I realized that I often missed the ritual rather than the alcohol. What’s cool to see is that there are more and more elevated drink options being created that are non-alcoholic first - so just a fun unique drink that has no relation to alcohol. Usually low sugar too. Very here for that!

My favorites so far: fun sparkling water (shout out to Barbet if you are also in Canada!), and sodas from around the world (try ethnic / niche supermarkets and have a blast!). I’m hoping to learn some fun mocktail recipes this summer too.

Question for today - Have non-alcoholic drinks helped you in any way? We’d love to hear your experiences. Even if it's water! If so, tell us which ones are your favorite so we can give em a try! :)

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hey friends, we are here on this Tuesday to not drink today, go us! It was really helpful to hear how everyone was approaching triggers yesterday - one thing I love about this community is that we all have such different experiences to bring. It’s like the world’s largest crowdsourced advice in one place so everyone can see what works for others, take what works, and leave the rest. 

Today, I’d love to talk about **mindfulness**. If you do it already, you’re probably like 'hell yeah!' If you don’t do it, you’re probably not AT ALL enthused by this topic. Mindfulness is one of those things that sounds ridiculous until it sticks. I have a ridiculously overactive mind and never thought I could do it. But now it is so helpful for me. I even give it a ton of credit for getting me to consider not drinking.

Late last year, I read the book ‘Unwinding Anxiety’. It is targeted at anxiety, but the writer is a neuroscientist who treats many people with addictions, from smoking and eating to alcohol. As I was reading, it made me think about applying the techniques to my drinking as well.

HIGHLY recommend the book for anyone who is anxious, but the drinking part that got me thinking was about using mindfulness to explore how drinking **actually** felt. This made realize that I wasn’t even enjoying drinking. The main tool taught in the book is using awareness to see how your body is feeling in response to something, to get curious about it, and label it. This process disconnects you from your automatic response. For example, during a drink, I took a step back to look at how my body actually felt.  (i.e. heart racing / head cloudy / etc). This got me to finally notice the anxiety inducing effects and how alcohol wasn’t adding any value to my experience, when usually I’d just think about getting another drink.

The other tool that I have found incredibly helpful here is the meditation app Balance. I’ve tried meditation SO many times over the years but Balance’s free year trial got it to finally stick. They have lessons to teach you day by day instead of throwing you in the deep end. Somehow trying to sit still for 5-15 min without learning any meditation skills did not work for me in the past, lol.

Both of these tools have helped me to slow down away from my automatic emotional response, so I can learn new habits and respond differently to what is going on.

Today, I’d love to hear: Has mindfulness / meditation helped you in your journey or do you have another tool you'd recommend instead?

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

It’s Friday SD — the day that used to get me. When I was *trying* to quit, I’d not drink during the week, then lose it Friday through Sunday. It was pointless and stupid and I was sick so often. Finally I *Decided* I wasn’t going to live in that endless spin cycle any longer. I was done. And I threw all of my energy into living a sober life. For me that meant a sober counting app to calculate time and money saved, reading Alcohol Explained, This Naked Mind and The Unexpected Joy of Being Sober.  It meant lots of seltzer and juice and exercise and so much time spent here on SD. All of the things. And yes, I still have battles, but I’ve also got tools as the work continues.

One last thought since it’s Friday - there are tons of us out there and We Are the Cool Kids 😎 Really.  Google Sober Celebrities and you’ll be amazed. The lists go on and on and on. Artists, actors, musicians, businesspeople. On and on ❤️ Happy Friday SD! I’m so grateful to say IWNDWYT and am sending love to all of you. Let’s Go!

And if you’re interested in hosting the Daily Check-in and have 30 days sober, reach out to u/sainthomer and he’ll add you to his list.

For fountains I would put my mouth over the stream and try to sip it, but it would take forever to get enough. Apparently you’re supposed to tilt your head sideways and let it fall into your mouth.

For straws I would put the opening between my lips and teeth instead of past my teeth, which is how everyone does it I guess so your teeth don’t get cold.

But onto my question, for drinking out of cups I let the water reach my lips and then I kinda suck it into my mouth, but now after all this I’m wondering if you’re supposed to just let it flow into your mouth then swallow? How are you supposed to do that without also swallowing air? Am I a moron?

Idk if I have some sort of trauma surrounding water before from I can remember, or it’s just that no one specifically taught me how to do these things, and my way has worked well enough for 20 years?

Anyway. Please help lol

EDIT: I really don’t think my boyfriend is gaslighting me like some are suggesting, I might’ve worded it poorly but he’s completely playful and joking, not genuinely criticizing.

Hello friends, it’s awesome to see you here today! This is my very first time hosting, and WOW it feels weird to be here. I hit four months sober last week, and this sub has been a huge part of that.

Huge thanks to u/PeacefulToday for hosting last week - loved the tone that you set for the week!

I’m “Sea-Independence-605” - this randomly generated username seemed way too appropriate when I created an account for this sub. Independent from the sea of alcohol, let’s give this a shot!

A little bit about me: My drinking became problematic when I had a very toxic job with a lot of free booze (advertising, if anyone relates!) and a toxic relationship, whilst being surrounded by many heavy drinkers.

This week, I'll share some of the things that have helped me the most so far. I’m still learning (four months streak) and this still feels very new, so I look forward to learning from you too.

Today: let’s talk about the DCI! My very first comment in the DCI was scary. I didn’t know what to expect. But each day, I received more supportive comments and upvotes. Each day, I felt a little better and learnt something to help me move forward.

For a while, I was WAY too nervous to reply to people here. Me, having anything to say to people with all my problems? I did not feel like I could possibly have anything to add.

But one day, another DCI host encouraged us all to reply to someone else (thank you!). And I realized I was being silly. Shame and hiding myself away just feeds the drinking. Regardless of where I’m at, I can contribute and encourage others. That process has been so helpful to me, to feel like a part of this supportive community.

So today if you have the time: reply back to someone else here to give them a HIGH FIVE for being here today. Sort by New and spread the good vibes around. Today we are not drinking, and that’s bloody awesome!

They seemed to think that they were above the rules and wanted everything done their way, regardless of how unreasonable it was.

One of the customers, a particularly arrogant man, requested a special drink that wasn't on our menu. I kindly informed him that we didn't have the ingredients to make it, but he insisted that I go out and buy them just for him. I explained to him that it wasn't possible, as the liquor stores were closed by that time, but he wouldn't take no for an answer.

That's when I decided to use malicious compliance to my advantage. I told him that I would do my best to fulfill his request, but it would take some time. I then left the bar and went outside for a few minutes, letting him stew in his own frustration.

When I returned, I presented him with a drink that was made with the cheapest, lowest-quality ingredients that we had available. The look on his face was priceless as he took a sip and realized that it was not the high-end drink that he had requested.

But the best part was when he demanded to see the manager, who had witnessed the entire exchange. She simply looked at him and said, ""Well, she did exactly what you asked for.""",t2_9omftbz2,"Sure, you can have a cocktail",t3_13bcefi,13bcefi,Koala_of_3vil,164,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/13bcefi/sure_you_can_have_a_cocktail/,0.98,3089,cocktails,0.4656420350074768,0.0445847362279892,0.1387092471122741,0.0752823576331138,0.0481528453528881,0.0776121765375137,0.0706571713089943,0.0346341393887996,0.0216019880026578,0.0231232810765504,0.9962910413742065,0.0037089830730110407

And if this is your first time hearing about my book, here's the description:

**When life gives you lemons, squeeze them into a stiff drink and stir.**

After twenty years defending the frozen north against some of the most dangerous threats in the nine kingdoms, Rhoren “Bloodbane” has finally earned his retirement. While the blood mage's service to the realm may have ended, burning veins and aching joints remain, and Rhoren soon learns that a warmer climate offers relief from his chronic pain.

And a chance at a fresh start.

In the warm and relaxing atmosphere of Eastborne, the umbral elf finds a new purpose and a sense of belonging. He may have left the frozen north behind, but he brings with him the skills and strength gained from a lifetime of defending the realm. Along with his most prized possession—a book of drink recipes inherited from his father.

Spilled cocktails may not carry the same weight as spilled blood, but opening a tavern brings a unique brand of challenges.

*""You can learn so much about a person by going through their personal refuse.""*

This is the very first entry into a series of original cocktail recipes that I'm creating themed around the characters, themes and events featured in *Yellowjackets*. I have a previous series of cocktails that I made for the final season of *Better Call Saul* that was well received from both the community and actual crew members of BCS - you can find the original eight at [this link](https://www.reddit.com/r/betterCallSaul/comments/wsoz7l/im_making_a_series_of_original_cocktails_based_on/) if you are interested!

I usually work to connect flavors, palettes and overall tastes with the subject of the drink (the best example of this might be [Saul Goodman's LAWYER UP](https://www.reddit.com/r/betterCallSaul/comments/wnn4b8/im_making_series_of_original_cocktails_based_on/) from my BCS series) to make it memorable. I love my craft liqueurs, but usually try to steer in a direction where most people can make these cocktails from home to share with friends while watching.

The first entry is dedicated to the one and only **Misty Fucking Quigley - ""MFQ""**. She can be very sweet and sugary, but looks can be deceiving - underneath those rimmed glasses is something sinister that we, as the audience, have yet to see the full extent of. Like Misty, the MFQ presents itself as sweet and harmless, but has spicy undertones that enhance the depth of the cocktail.

Here's the ingredient breakdown:

* 2 oz white rum (I use Havana Club)
* 0.5 oz spiced honey syrup (very easy to make from home: [see this recipe](https://www.liquor.com/honey-syrup-recipe-5075324))
* 0.5 oz cinnamon simple syrup (same as honey syrup: [see this recipe](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/cinnamon-simple-syrup-recipe-1938437))
* 1 oz freshly squeezed lemon juice
* 0.5 oz vanilla liqueur (I use Licor 43, but Galliano or others works just fine, too)

Before you begin making your drink, rim the cocktail glass with white sugar. This will provide you or your guests with the initial sweetness. Gently and precisely drop ice into the glass after you've rimmed it.

Pour all ingredients into a shaker full of ice. Shake for 10-15 seconds, then strain over ice into the glass you rimmed. I garnished this drink with half a cinnamon stick so guests can inhale cinnamon scents while they taste the cocktail.

The end product is essentially a drink that tastes like all of your favourite things from the spice aisle - cinnamon, vanilla, molasses, honey and sugar. Most folks will have the ingredients for this cocktail in their pantry, with an exception possibly being the vanilla liqueur. Pick up a little bottle for yourself - it's great for both cocktails and desserts that you want to enhance with something sweet.

I cracked it open and have found they are very different bourbons as Dalton to me has a much sweeter profile with notes of chocolate versus the Sinclair which to me is much more honey, vanilla forward. 

Long story short, I don’t see myself drinking much of the Dalton because it’s too sweet for my palate and is very much dessert. I don’t want to dump it.

The story features a blood mage who retires and moves south to open a tavern. Here's a quick look at some of what it offers as well as the book description:

&amp;#x200B;

* Cozy Fantasy
* Found Family
* Normalized LGBTQ+ relationships
* Slice of Life
* Retired Hero
* Opening a business
* Magical Creatures
* Delicious drink recipes

[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BT8S49LX](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BT8S49LX)

**When life gives you lemons, squeeze them into a stiff drink and stir.**

After twenty years defending the frozen north against some of the most dangerous threats in the nine kingdoms, Rhoren “Bloodbane” has finally earned his retirement. While the blood mage's service to the realm may have ended, burning veins and aching joints remain, and Rhoren soon learns that a warmer climate offers relief from his chronic pain.

And a chance at a fresh start.

In the warm and relaxing atmosphere of Eastborne, the umbral elf finds a new purpose and a sense of belonging. He may have left the frozen north behind, but he brings with him the skills and strength gained from a lifetime of defending the realm. Along with his most prized possession—a book of drink recipes inherited from his father.

Spilled cocktails may not carry the same weight as spilled blood, but opening a tavern brings a unique brand of challenges. With the right friends and a little bit of luck, he might just have a recipe for success.

1/ Tom Collins. What it is: Gin, simple syrup (sugar and water), soda water, lemon juice, and sometimes it will come with a cherry garnish. What it tastes like: Lemonade. You might get a hint of gin, but basically it just tastes like lemonade.

2/ Paloma. What it is: Tequila, grapefruit juice, soda water, lime juice, agave nectar or simple syrup. What it tastes like: Sweet and citrusy. At least for me I can barely taste any alcohol.

3/ Screwdriver. What it is: Vodka and orange juice. What it tastes like: Orange juice. 

4/ Gin or Vodka soda with lime. What it is: Liquor with soda water. What it tastes like: Basically a lime White Claw without the sugary taste. 

5/ Mojito. What it is: White rum or sometimes tequila, sugar, lime juice, soda water, mint. What it tastes like: Sweet, citrusy, and minty.

6/ Whiskey coke. What it is: Self explanatory. What it tastes like: Spiked coke.

7/ 7&amp;7. What it is: Whisky and 7Up/Sprite/Ginger Ale. What it tastes like: Spiked ginger ale. 

8/ Dirty Shirley. What it is: Vodka, grenadine (essentially pomegranate syrup), lime juice, Sprite/7UP. What it tastes like: Extremely sweet. Tastes like a cherry limeade from Sonic.

Over the weekend I brought a case of beer as thanks to the skydiving school where I got my license during my IOP program.  I brought carona for the beer fridge in the hanger, and brought a 6 pack of non-alcoholic carona so I could “drink with the bros” after skydiving.  

I thought it was a good way for me to participate in the culture while not drinking.

When I told my therapist about it today, she essentially shamed me and said that drinking NA beer is just as bad as drinking real alcohol because it uses the same neuro pathways.  And that it’s not abstaining because there’s &lt;0.5% alcohol in the drinks.  

I only had two of these NA caronas over the weekend, and was happy with everything regarding the situation.  But after her telling me that “it’s just as bad as drinking,” I’m a little peeved.

Anyway, I didn’t feel comfortable telling her that I disagreed.  But wanted to reach out for some support.  If it’s just as bad as actually drinking, why shouldn’t I go grab some real beer?

Love you guys.

Edit: my issue with alcohol was that I’d get drunk at cut myself.  And one day I got drunk and tried to commit suicide.  I didn’t have problems with “social drinking” and drinking NA beer with some dudes was far from a trigger for me.

Edit 2: not a single person I hang out with has ever “expected” me to drink, or asked me if I’ve wanted to.  I used to enjoy drinking carona socially and that’s why I got some NA caronas.",t2_95vczj4fk,Therapist told me NA beer is just as bad as actually drinking.,t3_1360lh9,1360lh9,newly-sober-69,640,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1360lh9/therapist_told_me_na_beer_is_just_as_bad_as/,0.94,1507,beer,0.2031292766332626,0.1265472024679184,0.1053486615419387,0.032910767942667,0.0385652147233486,0.3319865465164184,0.0169311352074146,0.0857842043042182,0.0435024723410606,0.0152945257723331,0.9858571290969849,0.014142850413918495

I distinctly remember his platform website was filled with vague buzzwords with Buck a Beer being the only formulated concept.

Instead, we ended up with one of the most politically active leaders we’ve witnessed in a long time.

He immediately axed the free tuition, basic income pilot, cap and trade system for GHG, cut spending on at risk youth, education, health care, environmental commission, cut Toronto city council in half, tried to fire Hydro One CEO

That was just Dougies first year!!!

In recent memory, he also had the province take over sole responsibility of building the Ontario subway line, built a new fucking highway, sold off a chunk of the Greenbelt, eliminated license plate fees and of course, leased some of the most valuable property in Toronto for 95 years in a deal no one else has reviewed.

&amp;#x200B;

* Beer Dad is rarely seen without his trusty 16 ounce YETI coozie.
* Whenever involved with any family activity or social function, the Beer Dad's top priority is to find a way to work in alcohol consumption. Oh hey, we should stop at this cool looking nanobrewery for lunch. Pay no attention to Beer Dad chugging three 8% beers in a single sitting.
* Kids' friends over for a playdate? Offer the other parent a beer. Who cares if it's 2pm.
* Any sporting event on television is an excuse to consume alcohol. World pickleball championships? Crack one open.
* Beer Dad ""deserves"" a drink for ""pushing"" a self-propelled lawn mower around the yard for an hour.
* After a long hard day of day drinking, Beer Dad is feeling bloated. It's time to switch over to bourbon. Everyone goes to sleep and Beer Dad passes out on the couch.
* Beer Dad has BIG PLANS for weekend mornings that never materialize.
* Beer Dad is hung over and grumpy to his kids. He'd rather let them spend hours on their iPads than interacting with them.

I’ve always heard it was really expensive to play in Richmond, Virginia compared to other places but I grew up here so I don’t have any comparison. I’m wondering if there’s anyone who’s paying more then us.

Our Summer Season of 13 games + single elimination playoffs is now $660. So saying you get eliminated in the first playoff game that’s roughly $47 (`660/14`) per game or $44 (`660/15`) per game if you get two games in. 

Anyone paying more per game then that?

Edit: We have to have a minimum of 15 players on our roster and the goalie also has to pay so it’s a minimum of $9900 per team if we have exactly 15 players. We have 19 players that all pay individually there are no team fees.",t2_qokjg,Beer League Prices,t3_135w5at,135w5at,Sohjiro12,315,https://www.reddit.com/r/hockeyplayers/comments/135w5at/beer_league_prices/,0.99,71,beer,0.5660920143127441,0.1379864066839218,0.062673769891262,0.0427983961999416,0.056201409548521,0.0226082354784011,0.0282553248107433,0.0173762124031782,0.0466549210250377,0.0193532984703779,0.9943615198135376,0.005638458300381899

Stopped by a grocery store and a liquor store just to find out they’re both out. So now I’m crying in my car outside the liquor store. I can’t even  fully explain why. Maybe because all the beer and seltzers looked SO good and tempting. Or maybe because I knew better than to walk down the vodka and tequila aisles. Or maybe it’s because I’ll always be an alcoholic. Perhaps it’s because there are some days I genuinely miss alcohol. Of course my life has improved since becoming sober. But I can’t deny that some days all I want is a drink. And I hate that I can’t enjoy one like normal people.

I went to a friendly local skirmish this morning.

It was a mix of people, some decent players, but mostly beginners and 12-14 year old kids.

And one 6'4 dude who decided that he was going to play all out and humiliate the beginners and kids that decided to show up to have fun and get better.

After he scored 3 goals in a few minutes, skating around everyone and hitting top shelf every shot on a 12 year old goalie, I started to get pissed. I started to check him harder, backcheck like crazy on him, you know, be on his case. I don't like ringers and I think it sucks for kids and beginners to feel they shouldn't even bother trying.

After a few minutes of me checking him much more intensely than what you would expect at a random skrimmage, the guy started getting pissed, and we exchanged a few heated comments.

I had to give up checking him hard eventually cause I just couldn't do it anyways. Luckily, he left after 45 minutes.

A few minutes after he left, a 14 year old kid on my team told me:

\- Have you seen Ben play? He's so good. He's in my class.- Which one if Ben?- Oh he's the guy that just left.

That 6'4 from before, who, mind you, had a full beard, was a 14 year-old kid.

Okay, so let's say you've got 100 people and only 1 beer to serve them.  20 of them are the kind of people who get upset if a pub doesn't have Carling or Foster's on ~~draft~~ draught.  20 of them are what we Yanks would call 'beer snobs.'  The other 60 run the gamut between the two poles.

Which one beer would minimize the grumbling from all quarters?

As for the USA, the answer is ""it depends on where you are.""  In California you'd either go with a beer called 805 or a Mexican lager such as Modelo.  In the northeastern US you might go with Yuengling, a bog standard lager by European standards, made by the USA's oldest brewery.  In Texas you would go with Shiner Bock; the beer snobs like it okay, and the shitkicker cowboys who prefer ~~pisswater~~ mass market light beer respect it because it's as Texan as it gets.

  I (M24) am married with Tina (26F) and we are expecting a baby, she is 11 weeks. Unfortunately, pregnancy is very hard for her, I try my best to support her the best I can, but to be honest our marriage isn't at its best at the moment, we had several arguments since the pregnancy. 

  
  She works at home and feels a bit lonely sowants me to stay with her as often as possible. So since the beginning of the pregnancy, I just go to work and stay at home with her. She doesn't feel comfortable going out because of the baby weight. It is not a perfect situation but I understand.  


&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I like to have a glass of wine at dinner or a beer in front of the game but Tina has asked me to stop because the smell of alcohol makes her nauseous, no problem.   
  Yesterday, in the afternoon my friend Matt called me if I could help him because he has a problem with his water supply (I am quite handy with housework, my father is a plumber so I help my friends sometimes). I asked Tina if I could go, she wasn't very hot but I insisted and told her it won't take long, and accepted. 

&amp;#x200B;

  
  I went to Matt's and we managed to fix the issue, he offered me a beer and I accepted, we sat and talked a little because it was quite long time we didn't hang out together, it was a good moment.  Before coming back I took a chewing gum to not smell beer too much. 

&amp;#x200B;

  
  I came home and when I kissed Tina, she smelled the beer and blowed up, she said I was a huge cunt, for abandoning her and the baby to get drunk with my friend and that I was  very inconsiderate with  her nausea problems. I answered that I only took one beer and I was just gone for 2 hours, I told her that she is controling. She was very angry, she said I was a shit husband and if I don't change I will be a shit father. I chose to going out and have a little breath because I was really shaken up.    
  She has been giving me the silence treatment since and I slept on the couch. I also received angry texts by MIL and SIL, they say I am asshole for not supporting Tina. I feel bad because I really try to do my best for Tina and our baby but I'm struggling too, and I honestly don't think sharing a beer with Matt was being incosiderate.

I just kind of want to talk about my improvements. So I was in a very dark place about 6 months ago. I was feeling really depressed and hopeless. Genuinely contemplating ending it all. But one day, I wanted a root beer, so I went down to the gas station to buy one. The only one they had was a jones soda. And for those of you who don't know, inside the caps of jones sodas are little messages or fortunes, or whatever you want to call them.
 
The one I got this night said, ""The coming month shall bring winds of change in your life."" So I thought screw it. Why not wait a month and see what happens. I felt like my life couldn't get any worse. I thought that if nothing got better, then I would just end it after a month.

And during that month I got a new, better job. Got into a better relationship, was able to move into my own place, and started working toward being a voice actor. It wasn't perfect but it was better. And I credit to the root beer that I had that night that convinced me to keep pushing forward.

[**The White Dress**](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/675yn1/the_white_dress/)**,** Posted on April 23, 2017

This story is about my friends MIL, and her wedding. Strap in guys, this is a wild ride in which I did THE THING that got me banned from any of her family functions. (Plus a few threats of dismemberment and bodily harm)

A good friend of mine from university was getting married! They had been a couple since Junior year of college, through her 2 years in the peace corps and currently her return to this continent. 6 years in total. She had been to all manner of family functions and always came back with a strange story about how she thinks her MIL secretly hates her. But she being a very quiet and sweet person pushed those thoughts aside.

Point 1: She is vegetarian and jewish, husband is not. She was invited and went to Christmas dinner and figured she would just eat sides, as well she brought a vegetarian casserole. MIL, after knowing her for THREE years, and being told by husband a few weeks before about not to forget friend doesn't eat meat...proceeded to put meat in every dish. Friend drank water and ate her casserole the whole night while MIL cried to everyone that friend was so rude for not eating her cooking.

Anyway, back to the story. A few friends and I were asked to be in the wedding. Friend has a HUGE family and so this was not going to be a small affair. Neither of them is particularly religious, but friend said it was would be nice to be married under a hoopa. (Think an arbor but 4 poles and covered with a white cloth and lots of flowers) Husband said he could care less, and told her to go and rent one for the wedding.

I was at the bridal shower when MIL found out the ""pretty canopy"" was actually a hoopa. She almost lost her shit in front of a bunch of people, but managed to compose herself and laugh angrily that ""if the jews were being represented so would the catholics."" In my head I heard a record screech, guys... they aren't catholic.

So after much fighting, a lot of screaming, crying, threatening to pull money (which is funny because she contributed nothing), MIL lost. The boot was firmly placed, and nothing was moving it. Hoopa yes, catholic priest no.

Things got stupid quiet, my friend texts me the night before the wedding that she has a bad feeling. I tell her it's probably just nerves, she is getting married and this is a big deal! Oh how wrong I was.

We all show up, get our hair and makeup done. Slip into our bridesmaid dresses and hang out waiting for the bride to be finished with her hair. She makes a comment saying she hadn't seen MIL all day and that she skipped her hair and makeup appointment. We all side eyed each other, took a few sips of wine and hoped the eerie feeling would go away.

30 minutes later as we are helping the bride into her dress; guess who shows up. If you guessed MIL, you win a cookie! Flushed from coming up the stairs, (she is not a light woman) in full hair and makeup...and a white dress. Not ivory, not cream, full snow-fucking-white. The dress was clearly a wedding dress; it was even from David's Bridal (which she would later shout at me). Floor length satin with a sweet heart beaded top, a bit of a train and off white lace on the bottom. The dress was even tailored to her, this has been a long con she has orchestrated.

The bride burst into tears and aunts and friends ushered MIL out. We did our best to console the bride, touched up her makeup, and I made her a promise that the dress would never be seen in a photo. She looked me dead in the eye and nodded. The game was on.

The venue only supplied white wine and champagne for the wedding party. But I grabbed my purse and ran down into the reception area and managed to flag an attendant by the bar and bribe him with a cool 20$ to give me a bottle of red early. I cracked the baby open, filled a solo cup to the brim with it and stalked outside. After a few swigs from the bottle for courage, I went over to where everyone was getting ready to take photos.

With one last hard stare at my friend, I got her nod of approval. I pulled out my phone, held it in front of my face like I was reading a text and walked straight into MIL. I poured the entire cup of red wine down the front of her dress, jumped back and gasped.

The look on her face was murderous. She screamed, yelled, threatened, and promised she would sue me. People had to hold her back because she wanted to fight me. Eventually she switched from screaming to sobbing and sank to the ground and threw a tantrum on the floor. Everyone moved back and just let her go at it and walked away to go take photos. It was surreal, as if everyone just hit their limit and noped out from around her. The 12 year old flower girl whipped out her phone and snapped a few photos much to our amusement.

This is already super long, but I will say that MIL went home and changed (only 20 min from venue) into a nice dark green too small and low cut dress. Because of this she missed all of the photos.

Wedding was beautiful; I got death glares from everyone she told that I attacked her with wine. No fucks were given as I drank and danced with friends. Bride thanked me in secret and 3 months later took me to the spa for a day of pampering. But I am officially ""that ISIS cunt"" to MIL, and I'll take it with pride.

**EDIT: You guys are awesome! Someone gave me gold?! WINE FOR ALL! In all seriousness, I'm glad you all enjoyed this story. I am not a super hero but I am a woman who has been kicked around a lot due to ethnicity by this MIL and had zero fucks left to give. Lone Ranger style my fight or flight reaction is permanently stuck on fight. The couple has been NC for the last year and half since the wedding.**

From the comments I could extrapolate that definitively it was a bridal dress, not a ballgown, not a prom dress, but a freaking bridal dress with beading, lace, tulle and sparkles, complete with bridal white shoes, and also she was kinda dancing with a column as a pole because she wanted a photo shoot  in the area where they were do the bridal photos. Also, MIL bragged about ordering the dress from a bridal shop.

[**Absolute Easter Chaos**](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/8aahyp/absolute_easter_chaos/) Posted on April 6, 2018

It has been two-ish years since the red wedding incident. NC from the moment that wedding ended has been absolute bliss for my friends.

This past weekend was my gal pal’s birthday. And she decided why not have a brunch on Easter on her badass rooftop in the city. So I fired up my cooking skills and make my famous vegetarian, crispy, turmeric, saffron Persian rice with roasted almonds and pomegranate seeds. (Tahdig for all my desert brothers and sisters out here)

What does this lovely brunch have to do with my sister from another mister’s MIL she has been NC with for almost 2ish years? I’m glad you asked llamas. Because bitch showed up. I’m not sure who’s Facebook she stalked, or what person she water boarded but she came from out of state and showed up at the front door of their apartment building.

I will rewind just a little. Friend and I are setting up on the roof, tossing pillows on the outdoor furniture and laying out some linens on the tables. Their apartment building is only 4 stories high, live on the top floor and are the only apartment with roof access. Because we were not sure that people would hear the buzzer inside of the apartment we put a sign for people to ring the bell and give a shout up to the roof (or text) and we would buzz them in.

So I’m meandering about fluffing pillows while happily balancing my mimosa when I hear someone yelling. I figured someone came early and friend went to go lean over the rood edge to see who it was. She immediate reeled back and spun to look at me. “It’s (name redacted)!!” She shouted as she ran for the apartment to stop the hubs from accidently buzzing her in.

I peeked over the roof and watched her for a bit. Pacing, freaking out, pulling on the handle of the door. She hit the buzzer maybe 10 times and then looked up and saw me. She was… angry. Flipped me off and went back to tried to yank on the handle and shout something about wanting to give her baby his Easter basket. The woman seemed unhinged. She was in fact carrying one those drug store giant plastic green baskets filled with crap so high to was wrapped in plastic.

So I did what any sane person would do, just parked myself there and sipped my mimosa watching her lose her shit and occasionally look up at me and shake her fist. Friend came back with husband and he peeked over to see her pacing like a damn hyena in front of the door. Since people would be arriving soon they worried she would force her way in with others. I posted on the Facebook group a quick rundown on what was happening, so people knew what they were possibly walking into. MIL then had a brilliant idea. She buzzed ALL of the other apartments, hoping someone might let her in, while she continued to call out for her son who at this point was hiding on the roof drinking straight out of the bottle of champagne.

Someone let the bitch in. She charged into the building and at this point friend’s husband whipped out his phone and dialed 911. He said and I quote “My unstable mother I haven’t spoken to in 2 years traveled across the country and showed up at my apartment screaming. She just broke in to the building and we are scared she is a danger to us and herself. We live XXX.” I’m pretty sure by the time this “I have bad knees and a thyroid problem” lady made it up the stairs to the 4th floor the cops were rolling up.

She never made it inside the apartment. When the cops confronted her she turned sickeningly sweet and begged them while she fake cried to see her baby. She tried to get the cops on her side to talk to him about going with her. Cops were having none of it and asked her if she was invited here and if she knew she was trespassing. Husband went out and told the police he wanted her to leave. This is where shit hit the fan. She lunged for her son and threw the basket at the police and tried to drag husband down the stairs. When he pulled away, she decided to just make a run for it. One of the cops grabbed her arm as she started down the stairs, which threw her off balance and she took the cop tumbling down a flight of stairs with her.

There were plastic toys, candy and that crinkly cellophane crap all over the hall and down the stairs. Watching her be put into handcuffs face down in all of was fairly amusing. Friend and I sipped our mimosas from the top of the rail. Trespassing, assault, assault of an office and two more charges are pending. It was a lovely brunch though.

**Edit: Recipe Tax**

    3 cups basmati or jasmine rice
    4 ½ cups cold water
    1 ½ tsp kosher salt
    4 TBSP ghee or clarified butter
    ⅓ cup plain yogurt
    1 egg yolk
    1 tsp saffron
    1 tsp turmeric
    4 TBSP ghee or clarified butter
    2 TBSP vegetable oil
    1 cup toasted slivered almonds
    ½ cup pomegranate seeds
    
    Add 3 cups of basmati rice to a nonstick 4-Qt pot. (Enameled dutch oven is the jam) Wash the rice with cold water, drain and repeat 2 more times. Drain as much of the water as possible.
    Add 4½ cups of cold water, 1½ teaspoons kosher salt, and 4 tablespoons ghee or clarified butter. Cover the pot and bring it to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat to medium low and continue cooking for about 10 minutes, or until all of the water has been cooked off. Remove from the heat.
    Transfer the par cooked rice to a shallow container and set aside. You will use the same pot to steam the Kateh. Now make the tahdig: Add one egg yolk, ⅓ cup yogurt, saffron and turmeric to a medium bowl. Whisk gently until combined. Use a large spoon to fold in 1 cup of the par cooked rice that is in the shallow container.
    In the same pot heat 4 tablespoons ghee and 2 tablespoons vegetable oil over medium low heat, until it sizzles.
    Add the yogurt and rice mixture to the pot and spread evenly to cover the bottom of the pot.
    Mix in the almonds to the remaining rice and add it to the pot and level off the top and gently pat down with the back of the spoon. (The reason I don't add the almonds in for the rice that is going to be crisped on the bottom, is that the almonds can burn and become bitter)
    Cover the lid with a damkesh or a large kitchen towel. Steam over medium low heat for 45 minutes to one hour.
    To serve, remove the lid, place a large serving platter over the pot. Hold the platter and the pot handles and invert the rice onto the platter.
    Pile pomegranate seeds in the center and some leftover almonds (or parsley) and serve! We eat it as a meal but you can roast chicken or lamb on the side. It pairs well with runny yolk fried eggs.

[Red Wine Girl and the Adventures with Crazy Bitch](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/8jpd2q/red_wine_girl_and_the_adventures_with_crazy_bitch/) Posted on May 15, 2018

Alright party people, this Crazy Bitch MIL needs a name since she apparently isn’t going anywhere. I am writing on behalf of my ultimate bestie who is reddit (and computer) illiterate.

Bitch bot will let you in on the juicy details, but yes. I am ‘That Red Wine Bitch’.

Anyway, so I guess you are all wondering why I called you here. When we last left off Crazy Bitch MIL was booked for assault on Easter Sunday, after showing up from a few states away and 2 years of NC. She did not post bail and sat in jail until her court date a few days ago. In which a sympathetic judge ignored testimony from the son AND the police officer. Her charges were reduced and she was let go after having to pay a pretty hefty trespassing fee and being told she had to keep her nose clean for a year.

So she then saw the error of her ways and pranced home. Yea. Fucking. Right.

Let me set the scene, Mother’s Day, 2018. Sunny, warm, with a hint of coastal breeze to make the weather perfect. Friend’s mother lives across the country so they decided to join our friends group at an outdoor event with sunshine, beats, picnic food and booz. We all had a wonderful time on my side of the pond.

They left to head home and a few hours later I received a very disturbing phone call from friend. Apparently Crazy Bitch MIL was staking out their apartment. She rented a studio a block away and just so happened to ‘run in’ to them when they were coming home. She was apparently upset that her son didn’t call her for Mother’s Day and wanted to let him know she officially moved here. Even though she literally owns a home in another state! She decided to rent an apartment in one of the most expensive cities in the country.

Friend is disturbed, and husband is in shock. He started paperwork on an RO and they got a RING cam just in case. I invited them to stay at my place, because apparently when friend left for work on Monday and Tuesday morning she saw Crazy Bitch MIL sitting in the café across the street reading the paper. Husband has been working from home and trying to figure out alternative ways out of his building.

He called some other cousins, aunts and uncles and told them what was going on. They are apparently not shocked. She had been planning this sudden move for YEARS. Spoke non-stop about her son and ME but never mentioned friend beyond making a face at her name. They never thought she would go through with it, and said she disappeared a week before Easter/never showed up to the family dinner. Bitch MIL is stalking me. Awesome. I expect two homeland security guys at my door soon enough. Sigh

Friend and Husband are coming over tomorrow to stay for who knows how long. They alerted their landlord who is at least taking the matter seriously and passed out fliers to the other tenants with her name and photo saying she was banned from the building. He is also going to keep an eye on the camera footage by the main door to make sure she doesn’t slip in with deliveries. He’s a great guy, I’m going to send him some cookies.

There you have it. I’m gearing up for guests and possibly a cash me outside moment with Crazy Bitch MIL.

**Ramadan Mubarak!**

**Persian Recipe Tax: Nan e Nokhodchi**

    1/2 cup vegetable oil
    3/4 cup confectioners’ sugar, sifted
    1 teaspoon finely ground cardamom
    1/2 tablespoon rose water (if you can get edible rose petals, those too!)
    1 and 3/4 cups fine chickpea flour (roasted if you can find it)
    2-3 tablespoons chopped or ground pistachios
    Combine the oil, sugar, cardamom and rose water in bowl. Using a hand mixer, mix on medium for 2-3 minutes until light and creamy.
    Sift chickpea flour into the bowl and beat on low for 1 minute until the dough is no longer sticky.
    Dust your work surface with some chickpea flour and knead the dough for 10 minutes until it is more workable. The dough is very crumbly.
    Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and set aside for 2 hours. Do not refrigerate.
    Preheat oven to 300 F and line baking tray with parchment paper.
    Roll out the dough on a dusted work surface until it is 3/4-inch thick. Cut out cookies using a 1-inch clover-shaped cookie cutter and place the cookies on the baking tray, spaced 1 inch apart. Re-roll and repeat until all the dough is used up.
    Sprinkle chopped pistachios on top of each cookie.
    Place cooking tray in middle rack and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until the cookies turn a light golden colour.
    Remove cookies from oven and let it cool on tray for a few minutes. Then carefully transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Be careful when you transfer the cookies as they crumble very easily.

[RedWhine, Ramadan and the Pork Chop](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/8lwfnx/redwhine_ramadan_and_the_pork_chop/) Posted on May 24, 2018

Hey party people.

If you have followed the shenanigans thus far you will know that RedWhine, (Thanks for the name u/clumber ) the crazy MIL that reappeared after 2-ish years of NC to throw metaphorical sugar in my friends gas tank of life.

Friend and husband spent a few quiet days at my house across the pond and eventually went back last Sunday. They have been leaving and going through a back exit that their landlord gave them a key to. For a little update, the RO paperwork is in, family has been called to get her ass back to bullshit land and now we just… wait. I appreciate all of the comments here and the people who offered sound advice, my friend and her husband followed a lot of it.

My juicy, hilarious and absolutely amazing tidbit for you all actually has to do with me! God I hate love this woman. So it’s Ramadan, and I’m on my fasting game. (Having weird fried chicken dreams) Headed over the pond yesterday to a fast breaking party called Iftar, which is when we are allowed to eat after sunset. Two other people headed to the party and I waited on the corner down from friend’s apartment building. We chatted, showed some memes and waited for them to come meet us.

Suddenly I feel this tap on my shoulder. When I turn around I am met with a fried pork chop a few inches from my nose. (It’s kind of a sail on my face) Confusion, more confusion, sudden recognition that RedWhine was standing there holding a pork chop at me. She then starts to gesture WITH the pork chop. “You think you can just corrupt my son?! This COUNTRY?”

She pointed the pork chop at me as the two friends I’m with start giggling behind me. And just for reference, they are two hijabis (kind of a slang we call young fashionable women in hijab) and I am not. I am the waist length wild curly hair trying to eat my head person.

I pointed at the pork chop and asked why she had it. To which she responded she was waiting for me. UGH… GUYS…. There it totally a leak somewhere! She knew about the time of the Iftar party and was walking around trying to find us with a fucking pork chop!

Hijabi 1 asked RedWhine if she was going to eat it, because she was hungry. Which seemed to piss her off since she yelled that she KNEW we didn’t eat pork! At this point I’m DYING; I have that ugly holding back laughter but not breathing face on.

Friend and husband come jogging up as she’s lecturing my hijabi friends on their own religion. Something something Trump, deported, and god’s wrath for non believers. (You have to take this crap with a grain of salt) Husband gets between us and is yelling at RedWhine to leave and we all make a hasty exit down the road.

I’m walking backwards watching her flail this pork chop around and point it in her sons face. And finally I just can’t hold it and laugh, full belly absolutely cannot hold it back anymore laugh. She points the pork chop over his shoulder at me and WHINES that he is hanging out with terrorists and she can protect him. (Apparently with her pork chop saber!) Husband pulls out his phone and says he’s calling the police, and like fucking smoke she disappears in the other direction. Glorious. Apparently she was telling him to come with her back home, that her sister was coming to get them (her) from our city of Sin and terrorists.

We sat at dinner, stuffed our faces and regaled the other party goers of RedWhine the crazy lady who tried to ward us off like vampires with a pork cross.

    Instructions

    Next pour enough water in to cover the meat and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover and simmer for 1 hour or until meat is tender.
    Add the dates, apricots and orange peel, stir to mix and cover. Simmer for 20 minutes.
    Stir in the honey and ras-el-hanout (optional) and simmer another 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. The sauce should be syrupy. If it is too watery, allow to simmer and thicken with lid off for 5 minutes, or add some water if necessary.
    Top with chopped cilantro and serve along side couscous and bread of choice.

[Rejoice pork chop wielding army! RedWhine has left the city!](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/92h0we/rejoice_pork_chop_wielding_army_redwhine_has_left/) Posted on July 27, 2018

This update is… interesting. Friend’s husband called me up a few days ago to sincerely apologize to me for what happened. (for the 100th time) He told me that the very next day she showed up to his apartment and slipped in with the postmaster. He got home from work to find her sitting on his floor a hysterical mess. Mascara running down her face, dirty, crazy hair and smeared lipstick mess. He found out then that she hadn’t actually been paying rent for a place to stay here and had instead been staying at a weekly pay motel. (Which she had not paid in some time and was kicked out) She was broke, homeless and firmly believed the terrorists were after her.

Without a beat he called the police and she was taken to lock up. He then called as many family members as he could to tell them she had a psychotic break and someone needed to pick her up. Only her sister showed up the next day and finally took her home. But she does back to come back in 3 months for her hearing of not keeping her god damn nose clean. (harassment and stalking charges) BUT!!!! The judge this time granted the RO. Glory!! Praise be, we have appeased the wine gods!

He has only heard snippets from family members, but she seems to be absolutely off the deep end. She is telling anyone that will listen that her trip to our city was AMAZING. She had such a good time. She spent so much time with her son…bonding. But the city was too big! And loud! And scary! So she just had to go home. And that one day soon her son (apparently told her) that he was going to go home too haha…. No.

They added a few more security measures and have returned to some semblance of normal. I feel awful for my friend and her husband, because there is this part of me that worries that this woman will never leave them alone until she’s dead or in jail. Hopefully her sister can do a better job of keeping her in their state.

    Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate 24-48 hours. Leave the marinated chicken out at room temperature for about 45 minutes before grilling.
    Prepare the outdoor grill for high heat because this Chicken Kabob needs to cook fast otherwise it will dry out. If using coals, they should be burned until they are covered with a white ash before grilling. The grill grates should be 4-5 inches above the heat source.
    Use narrow metal skewers to skewer the Chicken Kabobs. Skewer the tomatoes, onions and peppers separately because these vegetables do not cook at the same time. Spray or brush the skewered vegetables with a light coating of olive oil and a sprinkle of salt and pepper before grilling them.
    Place two metal bars (I purchased mine from hardware store) at top and bottom of the grill grate and rest the tip and handle of the skewers on the bars so the chicken and vegetables don't touch the grates.
    If there is not enough space on the grill for all the skewers, grill the vegetables first and keep them warm until you grill the chicken.
    Grill the Jujeh Kabob over high heat. As soon as one side starts changing color the other sides should be grilled so the hot fire seals in the juices. Then keep turning the skewers until golden brown on all sides and no longer pink inside. Check one piece of the Jujeh kabob by cutting through it with a knife, if it is white and juicy it is ready. Remove the kabobs that are ready from fire and keep them warm under aluminum foil and serve as soon as all are done grilling.
    Enjoy the Chicken Kabobs and grilled vegetables over Sangak (Persian flat bread) or Persian rice. If you are serving the chicken kabobs with white rice, add a dab of softened butter on top and toss gently with a fork to coat the warm rice, and sprinkle it with sumac for the traditional style. Serve the kabobs with extra lemon/lime wedges with a few wedges of fresh white or red onions.

My boss (40s, has a healthy 10 year old) said that if you just have 1 glass of wine only like once a week, our bodies will filter out the alcohol before it passes through the umbilical cord to the baby. She said it’s normal to drink now and then, especially in European countries. 

It’s not just from her though, I’ve had several women tell me that it’s fine to drink a bit here and there. Another friend said it’s ok once you’re in the 3rd trimester. 

Honestly, it’s kind of weird how often it’s come up. It’s almost like they are trying to alleviate their own conscience by getting me to join them?? 

I have absolutely *NO* intentions of drinking any amount of alcohol at any point during my pregnancy. Regardless of whether some people drink safely or if it’s not discouraged in other countries or whatever. It just doesn’t feel right to me. And it feels nice to take a complete sobriety break, TBH.

I don’t care, and always make a huge effort to accommodate and as a general rule when she comes to stay my husband and I will prepare and eat whatever she eats. My only issue is that she can be a bit self righteous about it. 

We’re close, she has been there for me when literally no one else was, I love her dearly. But bare in mind she has alienated and hurt other friends based on her vegan opinions. She is opinionated and very much feels she is better than other people based off her decision to not eat animal products. 

We met up recently at my house, with a few other friends and were drinking and generally enjoying herself when I noticed that the wine she had opened was not the specific vegan wine I’d bought for the weekend but rather one that was just in the fridge.

I quickly pointed it out to her, but she had already had almost a whole glass. 

At this point she goes off on one that all wine is vegan and i’m being ridiculous, if I have an issue with certain wines being drunk (it was a pricey one that she was drinking but that wasn’t the problem) then it shouldn’t have been in the fridge. 

I pointed out that actually not all wine is vegan, she can drink what she wants but I thought she’d want to know it wasn’t vegan. 

She is now badmouthing me for “calling her out” and being a know it all on her diet in front of other friends….

1058,2023-04-23 13:59:15-05:00,1682276355.0,stopdrinking,t5_2s7yr,"I started drinking when I was 15 years old (I am 38 now). Everybody, my friends, my family used to drink and nobody took any offense, even when I had my first black out experiences around the age of 16. I always was more on the shy and introverted side of the spectrum and used alcohol as a way to deal with social anxiety. 

In my early 20s I already drank a decent amount of wine (0,5-1 bottles) on a daily basis. I also used weed, cocaine, amphetamines, ketamine, ritalin - sometimes daily. When I entered my 30s - I was a dad, had a house mortage to pay and a demanding job - my alcohol intake reached a solid bottle of wine each day, every day. 

I never accepted the thought, that I might have a serious problem. I was so used to it. I was functioning. What could possibly be wrong? Then, I got divorced at 35 and that's when things got out of hand. I waited all day long to open my bottle at 4pm and had it emptied at 9. Needless to say, I opened another one and drank half of it too. My new partner - I thought she was rude and demanding - was the first person to really address my behavior as what it was: an addiction. I was angry, I was unfair and after 3 months I realized she was damn right.

I quit cold turkey one year ago. These are my observations, benefits and thoughts:

**Sleep**: I couldn't sleep for almost an entire week. I mean no sleep at all. It was crazy. After that week, sleep came back almost immediately. It's not that eyes-close-zoom-out feeling, like it was on alcohol. It feels healthy. And I dream again. I haven't dreamed in years.

**Men's health**: Morning wood. Oh my god. Morning wood. I completely forgot this was a thing. Also sexual performance. I was used to take forever to cum. Now my partner can jerk me off in a public place and I cum in minutes. This might sound normal to other men, but I haven't had this experience since I was 17. It all comes down to my testosterone coming back to normal levels, I guess.

**Gut health:** I suffered from irritable colon, lactose intolerance and stomach aches almost my entire adult life. This is completely gone.  

**Money**: Based on an average priced wine, I saved 2402€ that last year. That is grocery prices. Bars not included. They may add another 1k.

**Mental health:** This one is tough. I want to be honest. I still miss wine. I miss the taste, the release of dopamine, the association of coziness, culture and relaxation deeply engraved in my mind. There's at least on day per week, where I really miss the social aspects of alcohol consumption. BUT: I am FREE. I'm free of that nasty feeling of guilt. I'm free of an addiction that ruled so many aspects of my life. That made me mask my problems. I addressed so many of them that past year. It's not always easy but I love the feeling to be as close as possible to myself.

**Word of advice**: From my own experience. Beware of replacement addictions! My last resort so to say was caffeine. I drank 1,5 liters of coffee a day. Switched to black tea. 2 liters of that. Insane. I'm in the process of stopping that too. Tapered down the last months and today is the first day with zero caffeine. It feels great. Wish me luck.

**Last but not least:** Thanks to all of you. I was a silent lurker for a long time. But I got all my knowledge and courage to stop drinking from this sub and I'm more than grateful. Thank you very very much folks.",t2_kmzxxqek,"Today, I'm 1 year sober. Went cold turkey from 1,5 bottles of white wine.

On a rare crazy night, two bottles. 8 years ago I drank a couple of nights a week at most, but by the pandemic it was almost nightly, maybe a beer or two or four. Wine then was more for a nice dinner. During the pandemic we bought something like 10 cases of wine for “supplies” and my wife and I would start drinking it at like 2 in the afternoon. Within a year a bottle a day for each of us was normalized. Then even that started creeping up. And so here we are, a bottle for each of us every night is our life. No booze. No beer anymore. Just wine. Particularly red. The liquor store guy knows us by name, our kids are pros at opening bottles, cue 6pm and it’s wine-o’clock until a bottle or two are gone…each.. We both start getting irritable with how much the other is pouring themselves when the when supplies run low. 

My wife is more high functioning than me, even though she’s far smaller. Gets up, works out, no problem with work. But for me, the wine wakes me up with my heart racing at. 4am. Then I can’t sleep. I work from home so then I just sleep in. But with all that….my motivation is just gone, I’m a shitty worker now where I used to always be a star.. I don’t really care about anything I used to love. I’m also prone to snapping and irritability. I have zero patience. This never was who I used to be.

I can go tonight without drinking, but not tomorrow. If something bad happens today, I will drink for sure. This is no longer a social thing. It’s a need. Worse, my wife and I enable each other and can’t seem to quit for more than a day or two, cause one of us always drags the other down. 

I gotta stop, guys. It will fuck up so much in my life socially if I stop, but I gotta stop. How the fuck do I stop?

Update: Thank you all for your comments and suggestions. It was truly moving and emotional reading how many of you went through the same challenges. My family and I currently live in an alcohol-focused town with nothing to do but drink, but are going to be moving to a highly active community in a month. We’ve decided to taper down and drink our last remaining white wine between now and moving, and once in the new house I’m going to shift to NA IPAs and she’s going to shift to mocktails; but alcohol will be gone from our lives. Socially, we can still “drink” with people with NA drinks which I think will be important. But with this move the wine habit will hopefully be broken. Although from what you all have said, a new chocolate habit will be beginning… 👀 

I will update after the move with progress! Thank you all. Crossing my fingers. Looking forward to sober living!! I’m gonna get there and so will my wife!! Together!",t2_ulms59t,Yeah.

I’m hoping to yield 1 gallon to use to top off head space in a bananas foster mead before bulk aging. I’m assuming that my manually ripened bananas have a sugar content of about 16% on the conservative side and am unsure how to calculate estimated abv since there’s no way to use a hydrometer in the current banana slop, and I don’t really know what my volume yield will be yet either. 

Recipe: 
37 lbs of bananas ~ 3 Gallons
15g EC1118 + yeast nutrient
Enzymes - pectic, amylase A &amp; B

Process:

Chop and mash bananas, spread into sanitized Pyrex baking dishes. Add Amylase A&amp;B and bake between 150 and 170 degrees for 2.5 hours. Filled 3 gallon fermentation vessel up to the top and put in deep freezer. 

Next steps: thaw bananas and pitch yeast and pectic enzyme. Rack as necessary. I haven’t used bentonite before, but I’m thinking this one might be the time to actually try it. I may step feed honey in once fermentation starts if it looks like it’s actually producing liquid and not just a boozy fruit paste.

When Jean Luc Picard meets with the Malcorian leader in 2367/8, he shares a bottle of Chateau Picard. He comments that his brother, Robert, is quite good at making wine.

Robert and René die in 2371, concurrently with the events of *Generations*. The Vinyard continues, presumably operated by whatever staff Robert had hired as the Vinyard is too large to be run by one person and Robert eschewed technology.

The synth attack on Mars occurred in 2385. Picard retired in protest afterwards when it was decided that Starfleet would not assist in the evacuation of Romulus. It's likely that Picard continued to try and help the Romulans after he retired, using whatever influence and support he could rally without the direct involvement of Starfleet, until Romulus was destroyed in 2387.

&gt; 
&gt; **Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age**.
&gt; Privacy is not secrecy.  A private matter is something one doesn't
&gt; want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one
&gt; doesn't want anybody to know. **Privacy is the power to selectively
&gt; reveal oneself to the world.**  
&gt; 
&gt; If two parties have some sort of dealings, then each has a memory of
&gt; their interaction.  Each party can speak about their own memory of
&gt; this; how could anyone prevent it?  One could pass laws against it,
&gt; but the freedom of speech, even more than privacy, is fundamental to
&gt; an open society; we seek not to restrict any speech at all.  If many
&gt; parties speak together in the same forum, each can speak to all the
&gt; others and aggregate together knowledge about individuals and other
&gt; parties.  The power of electronic communications has enabled such
&gt; group speech, and it will not go away merely because we might want it
&gt; to.
&gt; 
&gt; Since we desire privacy, we must ensure that each party to a
&gt; transaction have knowledge only of that which is directly necessary
&gt; for that transaction.  Since any information can be spoken of, we
&gt; must ensure that we reveal as little as possible.  In most cases
&gt; personal identity is not salient. When I purchase a magazine at a
&gt; store and hand cash to the clerk, there is no need to know who I am. 
&gt; When I ask my electronic mail provider to send and receive messages,
&gt; my provider need not know to whom I am speaking or what I am saying
&gt; or what others are saying to me;  my provider only need know how to
&gt; get the message there and how much I owe them in fees.  When my
&gt; identity is revealed by the underlying mechanism of the transaction,
&gt; I have no privacy.  I cannot here selectively reveal myself; I must
&gt; _always_ reveal myself.
&gt; 
&gt; Therefore, privacy in an open society requires anonymous transaction
&gt; systems.  Until now, cash has been the primary such system.  An
&gt; anonymous transaction system is not a secret transaction system.  An
&gt; anonymous system empowers individuals to reveal their identity when
&gt; desired and only when desired; this is the essence of privacy.
&gt; 
&gt; Privacy in an open society also requires cryptography.  If I say
&gt; something, I want it heard only by those for whom I intend it.  If 
&gt; the content of my speech is available to the world, I have no
&gt; privacy.  To encrypt is to indicate the desire for privacy, and to
&gt; encrypt with weak cryptography is to indicate not too much desire for
&gt; privacy.  Furthermore, to reveal one's identity with assurance when
&gt; the default is anonymity requires the cryptographic signature.
&gt; 
&gt; We cannot expect governments, corporations, or other large, faceless
&gt; organizations to grant us privacy out of their beneficence.  It is to
&gt; their advantage to speak of us, and  we should expect that they will
&gt; speak.  To try to prevent their speech is to fight against the
&gt; realities of information. Information does not just want to be free,
&gt; it longs to be free.  Information expands to fill the available
&gt; storage space.  Information is Rumor's younger, stronger cousin;
&gt; Information is fleeter of foot, has more eyes, knows more, and
&gt; understands less than Rumor.
&gt; 
&gt; We must defend our own privacy if we expect to have any.  We must
&gt; come together and create systems which allow anonymous transactions
&gt; to take place.  People have been defending their own privacy for
&gt; centuries with whispers, darkness, envelopes, closed doors, secret
&gt; handshakes, and couriers.  The technologies of the past did not allow
&gt; for strong privacy, but electronic technologies do.
&gt; 
&gt; We the Cypherpunks are dedicated to building anonymous systems.  We
&gt; are defending our privacy with cryptography, with anonymous mail
&gt; forwarding systems, with digital signatures, and with electronic
&gt; money.
&gt; 
&gt; Cypherpunks write code.  We know that someone has to write software
&gt; to defend privacy, and since we can't get privacy unless we all do,
&gt; we're going to write it. We publish our code so that our fellow
&gt; Cypherpunks may practice and play with it. Our code is free for all
&gt; to use, worldwide.  We don't much care if you don't approve of the
&gt; software we write.  We know that software can't be destroyed and that
&gt; a widely dispersed system can't be shut down. 
&gt; 
&gt; Cypherpunks deplore regulations on cryptography, for encryption is
&gt; fundamentally a private act.  The act of encryption, in fact, removes
&gt; information from the public realm.  Even laws against cryptography
&gt; reach only so far as a nation's border and the arm of its violence.
&gt; Cryptography will ineluctably spread over the whole globe, and with
&gt; it the anonymous transactions systems that it makes possible. 
&gt; 
&gt; For privacy to be widespread it must be part of a social contract.
&gt; People must come and together deploy these systems for the common
&gt; good.  Privacy only extends so far as the cooperation of one's
&gt; fellows in society.  We the Cypherpunks seek your questions and your
&gt; concerns and hope we may engage you so that we do not deceive
&gt; ourselves.  We will not, however, be moved out of our course because
&gt; some may disagree with our goals.
&gt; 
&gt; The Cypherpunks are actively engaged in making the networks safer for
&gt; privacy.  Let us proceed together apace.
&gt; 
&gt; Onward.

Foods like french fries, dried fruit, and red meat all contain higher levels of sulfites than wine.

Wine headaches are most likely caused by something in wine called *biogenic amines* (histamine). Natural wines, bold red wines, and sparkling wines generally have the highest buildup of histamines. If you get wine headaches, it's best to avoid these.

If you do get headaches from drinking wine, it's best to stick to white wines and pale rosé instead.

They claimed that this practice could occur was the following: If it is a ""regular"" wine, the bottle will be replaced by another one, and no fee will be charged on the faulty bottle.

However, if it is a rare bottle (let's say a Rousseau 2009 Clos de Beze), then the usual practice is to share the risk, half for the restaurant, half for the customer. Meaning that if the wine is corked, the customer still would have to pay for half the price on the wine menu.

This seems a bit strange to me, as I would expect the risk for faulty bottle is already included in the bottle price markup.

Also, usually the restaurant would buy the wine for a price (let's say 400$), and put it on the menu with a margin (1,200$). If the customer pays half for a faulty bottle, the restaurant would still get 200$ for it, no risk taken there.

I had similar stories mentioned by wine professionals before.

What do you think about this kind of practices? Isn't the risk too high to order rare wine in restaurant?

EDIT: As /u/HateGary pointed, it does happen for some rare wines that the restaurant does not want to take the risk for faulty bottles. This is the case in the restaurant he mentioned.

(Update thanks to whoever reviewed the actual location also it’s amazing the amount of people with similar experiences at total wine) 

I got mad all over again writing this because of the sheer amount of disrespect from total wine management. I have the receipt for this order too. 

There’s a specific wine I use to pair with food the closest total wine that had it was a 60 mile drive and it was storming out and I wanted it for the holidays because most likely was going to be cooped up inside.

So I drive over, this used to be my typical total wine until I moved 2 counties away. 

Anyways I go in and pickup the wine and get some other stuff for holiday parties was in there maybe an hour and it comes time to check out and the cashier asks me for my iD so I give it to her and then she tells me she needs to see the iD of the other person I was with so now I’m confused and say I’m alone? And she says well I have to go get my manager. Ok fine? 

So he comes out to tell me that she told him I was with someone and they need to come back and bring their iD or they won’t sell it to me. 

I told him I wasn’t with anyone. He asks to see my iD looks at it and says “well unfortunately you look young”

At this point I’m like are you serious??? And he’s like “you can come back tomorrow ALONE” 

I find it extremely disrespectful to tell someone they look young while you’re holding their iD in your hand and not to mention I’ve been shopping at that exact location for about 4 years and have never had a problem 

So I told him about how I drove there and have been shopping there for years and that I even have a second form of iD and he was just kind of giggling and saying no.

So I left very angry and it was late around 9 pm and then I had the about hour and a half drive back home in the rain storm.

So I was home pissed about it all night and the next day I went in to the one close to my house to get the other stuff I was getting unfortunately that one was out of the wine that’s why I didn’t originally go there.

They were pleasant as usual actually beyond nice and didn’t even iD me which just goes to show the other location was on some kind of power trip or something. 


Then I got an email from them to review my experience. Which they send every time I go there and I never do it but I decided to select the location I had the bad experience at and give feed back on it.

So I wrote exactly what happened and then the next day I got a call from the store manager. Turns out the guy that night was an assistant manager or something. However he was much more pleasant than the woman that called me. She was extremely rude and condescending and told me that she reviewed the cameras and that someone walked in with me at the same time and that made us a party. I told her I didn’t know them. She said it didn’t matter. so apparently people can’t walk in to total wine at the same time as you???

Then she said that the employees were watching me and that the person left 30 minutes before I went to check out and they saw it.

Ok so? Also if that is the case and that is your policy, why didn’t you say something when you saw the person leave and we could have cleared up the whole situation right then and there. Instead of continuing to allow me to shop for another 30 minutes and waste my time to know that when I came to check out you were going to deny it? 

So I told her even if that is the case someone can’t leave a store??? And she said “no. To complete the transaction they would have to drive back with their iD” 

This made me extremely angry because even if that is the case and that is your policy at least you can offer an apology for the inconvenience or something like that. Not just call me to argue and stir the pot. I was already kind of over it because it had been like 2 days but just her whole attitude and nastiness about the whole thing was really insult to injury. 

So I decided to look up their policy and their policy clearly states that this only applies to parties at checkout so the rule is who is with you at checkout which that makes sense or is at least more understandable. 

Another policy I read which was interesting was that any online order not picked up within a week they will issue a full refund to your original payment method.


So my friends and I were sitting home drinking the stuff I had got at the other location later that day and telling them what happened and they were all shocked. 


I used to work retail for a long time specifically during covid and I know what an inconvenience it is to setup big curbside pickup orders because they take up a lot of space on the order shelf. 

So drunk and mad I decided to enforce their own policy on them and make a $10,000 order for the soonest possible pickup time which they promise orders ready in 3 hours.

So I made sure to order the cheapest heaviest bottles I could think of so it can take up the most amount of space in their curbside are and made sure to only order like 1 or 2 of each so they couldn’t just give me a case they had to get individual ones and I ordered their whole supply of Tito’s since it’s popular and it’s the holidays and I know people are going to be looking for it and this total wine has its curbside order section in the front behind a counter where you can see it 

And I know when customers saw it they would ask for it and then they would have to explain how someone ordered all 238 bottles and they’re back there on reserve. Then they’d probably get grouchy and ask for a manager.

But the manager would be busy because I also made sure to order a lot of bottles behind glass so they would have to run around with their keys scrambling to get this order ready. I worked retail and I know how much stuff like this throws off a schedule and annoys the managers. 

So I loaded up the cart and stopped when I got bored and placed the order. I got the email confirmation which specified that you have to wait for the pickup confirmation email and that pickup times aren’t guaranteed so I thought for sure they were either going to cancel the order or call me or something.

And something interesting that is sent with the email is a pickup policy that states specifically “the recipient of the order needs to be 21” so you can have other people in your car not 21??? 

Well 5 hours later I got the pickup email. It took them longer but I was still surprised.

Then later I got a pickup reminder email. Then 3 days later a second reminder. Then 7 days I got my “final notice” email

And then day 10 I got a phone call. It was the manager acting like a completely different person this time asking when I was coming for the order. At this point I think she knew I was fucking with them because it had been 10 days and she knew my name from the previous feedback thing because when she called she asked for me by name and my name was on the order 

So I told her “yeah I went to pick it up and was told I look too young, so I just went to the other total wine and picked it up the same stuff there” 

So then she was mad and said “are you seriously not coming to pick this up?” Lollll restockkkkkkk 

I just said “nahhh”

She hung up lmfaooooo


When your higher up asked you why your store had to refund someone $10,000 explain to them what you did  lmfaooo.

They were supposed to automatically cancel the order at the 7 day mark but didn’t she called me at the 10 day. 

So I called their customer service line to cancel it and she told me some stores wait to the end of the month to do it. 

I’m assuming the manger was trying to hold out on refunding to end the year on a better number. Retail does that.

I made them cancel it right then lmfaooo",t2_ze0c9,Total wine would not sell me the specific wine I drove 60 miles to that location for because they claim I was with someone else who left and they need to see iD for that person.

However, there are a handful of wine YouTubers that helped me develop a stronger knowledge and  tend to make videos more geared towards people looking to expand beyond the basics. Here are some of my most watched YouTubers that I feel don’t get the attention they deserve:


- AttorneySomm: Excellent in-depth informational videos about wine collecting, regions, styles, specific producers, buying guides, etc. from a corporate lawyer with a level 4 WSET diploma. I love the way he presents information and I always feel like I learn a TON from just one of his videos. John is also very active on Instagram and his posts are awesome. His collection is drool-worthy. 


- Dr. Matthew Horkey: Blind tastings and wine travel vlogs. I love Matt’s personality and he is extremely knowledgeable and experienced. His channel started out more geared towards wine travel vlogs and he has made some excellent cinematic videos touring famous regions and interviewing local experts and producers (I especially love his tour of Champagne video and find myself rewatching it). Lately he has focused more on blind tasting videos and they are super fun to watch and very informative.


- The Wine Archive: A fairly new wine channel for Bordeaux lovers. Yannick does some great wine reviews and has excellent production quality, but what I love about his channel is he does full-length vertical tastings with the winemakers of famous chateaus like Lagrange, Pichon-Baron, Beychevelle, La Conseillante, etc. and you get to hear the winemakers talk about each vintage in-depth. The vertical tastings are just fascinating for me personally.


- Julien Miquel: If you care about pronouncing French and Italian wine words correctly, this is a channel dedicated almost solely to pronunciation. I find myself always revisiting his videos to hone my pronunciation of tricky producer names like Ducru-Beaucaillou. Julien worked at many of the famous chateaus and also posts some great informational videos about wine regions, producers, etc. which I certainly watch too, but I mainly like his channel for pronunciation. This guy must have posted thousands of videos at this point, it’s truly impressive. 


- V is for Vino: this is an actual wine travel show with a camera crew that looks like it could be on TV. He posts full-length hour long episodes on YouTube, each dedicated to a specific region. In these episodes he tours vineyards, speaks to winemakers, stays with local families, etc. My favorite episode would have to be the Bordeaux one. 


- SevenFifty Daily: this is the YouTube channel of a wine magazine and it doesn’t seem like the channel is active anymore but they had an excellent series called “Supertasters” where they showcased blind tasting tests from master sommeliers and MW’s. Very fascinating to see these experts try to deduce the varietal, region, sub-region, and vintage just like they would in an exam. This taught me a lot about how wines should be examined.

It’s all about him, and he forgets she is in the room. Jasmine added that the performance is rooted in insecurity. No matter how much you guys love him, that sounds pretty accurate and not all that appealing. If they didn’t have cameras around them all the time, he would perform less. It might be a character trait that was annoying, but one Gina could ignore. With cameras around all the time, he’s probably doing it a lot. The cameras probably make it a bigger problem than it is. I am married to a life of the party sort of guy. It can be cringy and lonely, but it’s not like we’re at parties every night. If it was a daily thing, I can see how it would be too much.

exeCute automates most things around configuring Wine. You just have to click on the executable you want, and exeCute configures Wine optimally.

Lately I have been improving it drastically, and now it automates all these things:

\- Selects if to launch with Wine or Dosbox.

\- Installs dxvk vkd3d, so all DirectX applications run fast using Vulkan as backend. Skips if the GPU doesn't support Vulkan.

\- Mounts any disk image found in the executable folder, simulating a physical disc.

\- Sets DPI according to the current resolution.

\- Restores desktop resolution if Wine hasn't done so.

\- Enables quality midi through Fluidsynth and soundfont-generaluser.

\- Simulates a virtual desktop if you place a ""desktop.conf"" file in the application folder with the desktop resolution you want.",t2_2v3gnt,Improved Wine gaming with exeCute,t3_12ysjlo,12ysjlo,es20490446e,76,https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/12ysjlo/improved_wine_gaming_with_execute/,0.94,252,wine,0.2764411568641662,0.046495147049427,0.5005567669868469,0.0215093363076448,0.0224228259176015,0.078877680003643,0.0078934645280241,0.011909894645214,0.0099633503705263,0.0239303316920995,0.9913249611854553,0.008675049059092999

1181,2023-04-03 16:23:59-05:00,1680557039.0,stopdrinking,t5_2s7yr,"I think last week was probably my low point. At least, my recent low point. I struggled with substance abuse and dependence in my 20s... got over that after a few (okay more than a few) VERY contentious years. Cleaned up and am a happily married mother of two young boys who I adore with all my heart.

And somehow, everything is the worst. My job is awful. I'm so burnt out I can barely function. There is tension at home between me and my husband, but ""tension"" is honestly the worst of it... we're just two super stressed out people and our lives revolve around household logistics. We are in marriage counseling to help navigate those issues, and it seems to be helping.

But outside of that, I'm a fucking wreck. I have gotten some degree of blackout drunk every night since... I think December. I'm so depressed I can hardly think straight. My every moment is consumed with how depressed I feel, which is stupid. I go to work, am miserable, come home, watch kids while husband works, put the kids down, and then I drink. It's gotten to the point where I don't think I could even begin to do dishes in the evening if not for almost an entire bottle of wine first. I'm the suburban mom, I drink chardonnay, it's ha ha a thing, right? Everyone always gets me a bottle of wine, for like any occasion. Fucking stupid wine mom culture that I'm not even a part of. I just happen to like it, and it's easy.

Well, it used to be easy. Used to be ""ugh, I'm gonna stop by the store and pick up a bottle of cheap white because today sucked."" And then it would be fine, I may not even finish the bottle. I do not even remember how it became every day. But eventually I switched to boxes because it was more ""economical."" And also, who's counting?

I used to wait until 8:30pm when both kids were asleep. I'd have a few glasses and time to myself, then go to bed. On days I didn't drink, I'd engage in my hobbies of writing or watching movies or whatever. Now I don't do either. I just drink. And, it went from 8:30 down to 8:00 down to 7:30 and then 6:30 and then yesterday it was 6:00. Last Friday was my colleague's last day at our awful job... we went out for lunch, as the boss was on vacation. You can imagine how that went. I think I had like 5 or 6 double bourbons (short, because let's face it, I just want to get drunk). Just like how at 6:30 every night, that I wait for EAGERLY, I fill up about the entire wine glass and then LITERALLY CHUG half the glass right away. What the fuck? Who does that? Me. That's who. I still am with it enough to put my children down for bed but not without another glass already filled up. I can polish the bottle in 90 minutes, but then would need more so... hence the boxes.

Anyway, yeah, I got fucked up on Friday and then proceeded to drink the entire day, DEFINITELY got caught by my boss who randomly showed back up looking for me to sign a check or something. I--to be clear--wasn't drunk at work, so technically I didn't do anything wrong except leave early but I'm salaried and who cares. But yeah, it was not great. I don't remember the rest of the day. I went for a walk in a severe thunderstorm, I know that. Got completely soaked. Oh, and at one point I was full on ugly crying in front of my two colleagues. Can't remember what about.

It occurred to me that I forget a lot of things. Then it occurred to me that I black out, every night. And I am so, so, so depressed. I am sad all the time. I feel no joy. I have to FORCE a smile on my face when looking at my toddler who just wants to play but I have no energy. I have to make myself smile at my infant who is such a happy smiley little chub. How sick is that? Why can't I just smile? Enter the extreme mom guilt... I know I love my children, so why do I not feel happier when I'm with them? I'm just exhausted. So, so exhausted. All the time. I just want to curl up in the dark and be left alone forever. At one point I remember looking at my life insurance policy... I think that maybe told me what I needed to know. I'm not just ""in a rut.""

So today I went back to work after--you guessed it--drinking all weekend and drinking extra last night, and then I had a full on fucking panic attack... and I do not get panic attacks. I was unsure of what it was at first, feeling like maybe my body was finally giving out, I don't know. My heart rate skyrocketed, I couldn't focus and I couldn't feel my hands and I felt like I was going absolutely insane. I used my insurance app to get a telemedicine appointment with a psychiatrist within an hour which was super handy, and in that conversation I also accepted that I have ""chronic pain,"" which is true, and that fine maybe it bothers me. I was honest, said I drink every single day. A lot. At first I said just one bottle, but then I said honestly it's probably closer to two. They prescribed an antidepressant for now that is supposedly helpful for both depression and chronic pain, but I am also going to come clean to our therapist and go from there. And if you're wondering about my husband, he obviously knows I drink most nights (he works from home and is in his office a lot, so he doesn't experience all of it)... he doesn't know the rest of it, but he will.

It'll start tonight. Oh, and I gotta get my flair reset... I've been ""intending"" on quitting for a while now. You know how it is, I suppose...

But, yeah. IWNDWYT.

EDIT: I will call my physician's office tomorrow morning. &lt;3

EDIT 2: I am so truly, deeply touched by everyone here. I am honestly sort of shaken, in a way. I wrote all of that out in one sad sitting and it was the first time much of that has been put into real, meaningful thoughts, let alone real, meaningful *words*. And seeing how many other women have struggled in this way... it's very eye opening. That culture is so dismissive and destructive, and as someone who previously really suffered with substance abuse and dependence, all I ever wanted was for someone to tell me it's okay to indulge, you know? Like ""no, it's not okay to have 5 to 7 shots of liquor every night... *you're a mom*! Here, have this bottle of wine instead :)"" Super fucked up.

I miss not waking up every single day and thinking about when it will be early enough for me to *literally slam an entire glass of wine* and then *immediately refill it to the top*, and then *immediately get anxious because half the bottle is gone and it's only been half an hour and you can't buy alcohol after 9:00 PM.*

It's like a mental prison. Fuck. I hate it.

Anyway, thank you everyone really this has been a very cathartic experience just writing this post and seeing the immediate outpouring of support and I am going to be calling my doctor first thing in the morning, and then calling HR and requesting the rest of the week off.

I work in the US at a state store (government owned and operated wine and liquor store.) On Friday, we sold 48 bottles of sparkling wine to a guy for his kid’s wedding. 

Today, he tries to return 33 bottles. Normally not an issue. As long as you have your receipt, the bottle is unopened, and it was bought in the last 2 weeks, we can provide a refund. Only issue is this guy didn’t have a receipt. 

We tell him we can’t do anything without a receipt. He completely blows his lid. Starts screaming at all the employees, telling us he was never told he needed a receipt to return. We point out the return policy posted at both checkouts and written on the back of the receipt paper. 

He keeps freaking out. My assistant manager calls out district manager, and the DM reiterates what we already told the guy. Our hands are tied. He threatens to dump every bottle on the sidewalk. 

Instead, he decides to leave the cases of wine on the sidewalk in front of the store and drives away. We bring the cases into our backroom, and let the DM know what happened. We technically can’t do anything, as the wine is still his. We’re still waiting to hear back as what to do.

The second I opened the bottle I smelled it: lots and lots of wood. When I poured it I was in shock. I’ve never seen a wine quite like this before port and sherry perhaps but I was expecting a fairly regular white wine. So the taste had lots of wood obviously and it was also quite dry and full bodied, It reminded me a lot of a white sherry in some ways. Luckily enough, it paired really well with pasta carbonara. 
Now I’m fairly new to wine and my question is: what kind of wine is this?

exeCute  automates most things around configuring Wine. You just have to click  on the executable you want, and exeCute configures Wine optimally.

Lately I have been improving it drastically, and now it automates all these things:

\- Selects if to launch with Wine or Dosbox.

\- Installs dxvk vkd3d, so all DirectX applications run fast using Vulkan as backend. Skips if the GPU doesn't support Vulkan.

\- Mounts any disk image found in the executable folder, simulating a physical disc.

\- Sets DPI according to the current resolution.

\- Restores desktop resolution if Wine hasn't done so.

\- Enables quality midi through Fluidsynth and soundfont-generaluser.

\- Simulates a virtual desktop if you place a ""desktop.conf"" file in the application folder with the desktop resolution you want.",t2_2v3gnt,Improved Wine gaming with exeCute,t3_12ysmfy,12ysmfy,es20490446e,54,https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/12ysmfy/improved_wine_gaming_with_execute/,0.97,314,wine,0.2764411568641662,0.046495147049427,0.5005567669868469,0.0215093363076448,0.0224228259176015,0.078877680003643,0.0078934645280241,0.011909894645214,0.0099633503705263,0.0239303316920995,0.9913249611854553,0.008675049059092999

edit: ty for trying to put sense through my head.
ngl i am upset over being upset about how none of u said its okay to prolly have it once a week. also, over how stupidly easy it is to still fall back in this loop of just a lil  or how tantalizing the thought still seems even after a full year of not even touching beer. some of the comments really made me halt and cancel the order of the 24x490ml can carton. ridiculous fr, idk what gets over me i actually ordered it thinking well just once a week, i ll have it chilled, i ll sip slowly lmao the fantasies were here already. ik i would be waiting all week to just get the can and call it ""relaxing on the weekend"" lmao. its very much saddening how i am actually still upset about deciding not to have it once a week. fuck alcohol, too addicting it is. one year of progress feels like absolute shit rn.

edit 2: just wanted to say i am extremely grateful to everyone who had something to say. still bitter over nobody saying its okay go fetch a can every week haha but i am glad, beautiful how people on the phone helped me stop doing smth i'd later probably be crying about. thank you so much, this is a great community.",t2_o582bhfg,I completely quit my beer and wine but after a year of no drinking i had a sudden urge and had this 500 ml strong beer can yesterday,t3_135ffth,135ffth,Melodic-Key-3326,55,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/135ffth/i_completely_quit_my_beer_and_wine_but_after_a/,0.97,73,wine,0.2426138371229171,0.2678546607494354,0.0934084579348564,0.0257446654140949,0.056167472153902,0.1859674006700515,0.0125900078564882,0.0705668777227401,0.0300940033048391,0.0149926664307713,0.9947909116744995,0.005209100898355246

I opened up about my feelings and where he sees us going. They admitted to me that they're interested but don't have the same amount of feelings for me as I do for them. They don't feel the immediate spark with me that they ""have had for others in the past"". They want to keep being friends with benefits and see where it goes. ""Maybe we will work out and we'll date but maybe we won't"".

I've had this happen in my past and it never ends well when benefits are included. I don't want to get hurt again, so I broke it off, and decided to remain friends with no benefits. Maybe something will bloom through a friendship, but I won't hold my breath.

I'm a bit taken aback, and my self-confidence and heart is pretty bruised. I so desperately wanted to drink and drown my sorrows, and I was only a few feet from the door of the liquor store, but instead, I went home and had a good cry and am now going to sleep.

I don't know why I'm posting this. I guess I am just proud that I was able to say no and chose to deal with my emotions in a healthy manner instead of destructive.

Thanks for reading. IWNDWYT

Edit: Woah I did not expect so many lovely comments when I posted this. I've read each and every one and all of the love, kindness, and support shown here made me cry again (tears of joy this time though! 🥹). Thank you so much for reading!

To those who wrote that this post helped them or that they could relate, I'm so glad to hear this helped you in some way. Lord knows I've read so many stories on here that have helped me resist temptation so it's nice to be able to give back in that way.

Stopped by a grocery store and a liquor store just to find out they’re both out. So now I’m crying in my car outside the liquor store. I can’t even  fully explain why. Maybe because all the beer and seltzers looked SO good and tempting. Or maybe because I knew better than to walk down the vodka and tequila aisles. Or maybe it’s because I’ll always be an alcoholic. Perhaps it’s because there are some days I genuinely miss alcohol. Of course my life has improved since becoming sober. But I can’t deny that some days all I want is a drink. And I hate that I can’t enjoy one like normal people.

(please don’t drive drunk)

So I had this thought about getting a Dwi and how you have to be breathalyzed and do walking and eye tests. so what would happen if after getting pulled over you know that you’re going to get arrested when the cop sees you so you get out of your car and pull a bottle of liquor out of a bag and chug A shit ton of it next to your door (whiskey vodka etc.) so the cop can see you do it. Could the cop even prove you were drunk before drinking outside of your car? Could you legally play it off as a political act of rebellion against A cop?

I am 24F but very babyfaced and still get asked for my ID if I go to a new store or there is a new cashier. Just went to a liquor store a couple hours ago and when I was checking out the new cashier said light heartedly - “no asking for your ID anymore, they told me last time you come here all the time!”. 

I also have a 7/11 that sells alcohol right down the street from me, so it is hard to quit because I can literally just walk across the street and get a few singles. Then once I start drinking I won’t want to stop. But I can’t afford to move anytime soon. For the last year or so, i always get sympathetic looks from cashiers and obviously i know this is all my fault, but i can’t help but to feel embarrassed and they see me as a loser.

While they were here, they visited with us as well as some of their long time friends. They are both semi-heavy drinkers so while on their visits with friends, they acquired two handles of vodka, a handle of jim beam bourbon, and a handle of fireball to drink over the week. 

Both of them know that I have stopped drinking. They know I've been sober since December and know the reasons why I have quit. They know I don't keep alcohol in my home anymore and my husband has even let them know that we don't want it in the apartment (he drinks occasionally while out with friends, but respects my not wanting it in the house). On the last day of their visit while packing up, my MIL asked us if we wanted to keep what was leftover in the handles. Obviously I said ""no thank you"", but she insisted that we keep the handles here ""for our friends"". So instead of just accepting my answer, she tucked a handle of vodka and the jim beam next to our china cabinet without me noticing. She texted my husband later asking if he saw that she left the alcohol for us. I was so put off by this that I took the handles and dumped them down the sink and took the bottles to the trash immediately.

I don't understand MILs logic on WHY she needed to give the bottles for us when she knows I can't be around it. It may have been for our friends, sure, but it feels sabotaging to my sobriety on a personal level. And there may be a lack of respect on her part towards me. 

I will say, I felt very empowered and strong for dumping the liquor out. My sobriety is very important to me and I can't let a family member try and ruin it.  

If anyone else has experience like this with a family member, let me know! Would love to hear how you set some boundaries. Just goes to show that some people take our sobriety personally and make it about them instead of just respecting the other person's journey.",t2_1vv60nac,MIL left handles of liquor at my apartment after her visit....,t3_135ltlg,135ltlg,hawkbit92,60,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/135ltlg/mil_left_handles_of_liquor_at_my_apartment_after/,0.99,101,liquor,0.2556978464126587,0.1845467090606689,0.1184142902493476,0.0360597372055053,0.0951325148344039,0.2175685614347458,0.0414427034556865,0.0148006360977888,0.0183555353432893,0.0179814733564853,0.996256411075592,0.0037435339763760567

1311,2023-05-11 12:07:35-05:00,1683824855.0,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,"Hi guys. 

First some background info:

The russefeiring (English: ""russ celebration"") is a traditional celebration for Norwegian high school pupils in their final spring semester. Pupils that take part in the celebrations are known as russ. Students in high school normally prepare for this celebration from the start of the year. Russ celebrations normally happen before the final term exam for the high school students before they are off to university or college. Russ have different ways off celebrating this very day, some people purchase big buses with more than 20 people partying all night and some other people go for the more cheaper or more idle version like buying a van or a car. The russefeiring traditionally starts around 20 April (with some starting earlier/later depending on the regional county) and ends on 17 May, the Norwegian Constitution day. Participants wear coloured overalls (Usually red, blue, green, white, or black). Some form groups that name a bus, car or van (often making a name or logo). Some celebrate almost continually during this period. Drunkenness and public disturbances are regularly linked to the celebration.

As you probably understand, this is a crazy period for everyone involved. Including everybody, since they install comically large sound systems on their buses, drive around after dark and pumping it up. 

Anyways, they drank something unknown from the same bottle and all of them experienced the same symptoms: A burning stomach pain, hallucinations, anxiety and a sensation of not being able to breathe. 
I am a bit puzzled over this case. I consider my drug knowledge somewhat above average, but this one is strange. 
Anxiety, hallucinations and stomach pain could be the explained with i.e. psilocybin. It’s the burning stomach pain and the sensation of not being able to breathe part that I’m not able to figure out. 

All of them was taken to E.R, and media reports the hospital now has sent text messages to 2 of the involved, stating “No new type of drug is found.”. The Police refuse to comment further yet. 

Can you help me understand what this drug might be?

Yeah, I have regulars. Marla gets a pint of Smirnoff Pink Lemonade twice a day. Once before her waitressing shift and once after. 3 extra airplanes with her second stop. Her daughter just got married. We all (the staff) got her a card with $1-5 pitched in. 

William gets a fifth of captain every day, at 9:05 am. He’s looking worse for the wear. His skin is light yellow and and his hands shake. But, he doesn’t slur, is always polite. We would never decline his sale for no no reason. He’s a chill dude with an Air Force background. On his good days, we talk about reality Tv. William is always welcome. Sometimes we do samples. He’s not a pity. He’s William.

John drinks bottom shelf vodka. Once in a while, he’s too turnt, and we can’t make the sale. Like knocking my bottles over. We get arrested if we sell and someone commits manslaughter while being sold inebriated. I’ll call an Uber, I’ve paid for a few. It’s okay. We’re not judging. 

Mike is pervy. He buys 3 double shots of Smirnoff at a time. Said he wants to drink my bath water. I communicate with other stores once every three months or so, to see if he’s been by. They know him. He rides his bike taking shots. I sometimes tell them he’s on the way. Again. We get arrested selling to inebriated. 

My point is, yes, we notice regulars. We’re retail clerks; what else do we have to look forward to other than friendly and relatable faces? We do not care what you drink, other than the thrill of being able to grab it for you without you asking. Come in daily, twice a day, we are happy to see you. 

I’m not on this sub because I’m a twice a month glass of wine. You know why I’m here. The irony of my profession doesn’t escape me. 

Stop worrying what we think. We have 30 cases of Tito’s to put out. Please. You’re welcome, noticed, and appreciated, as long as you aren’t knocking over displays or dropping bottles.

Subject: Complaint against Sommelier Select Liquor

Hello,

I would like to register an official complaint against a liquor license holder, Sommelier Select Liquor, licensee # 78253300, for violating sections 7.1.3(a,b) and 7.1.4(f) of the Licensee Handbook.

The official social media pages on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sommselectls) and [Facebook](https://facebook.com/Sommelierselect/) both show continued and sustained violations of these policies, promoting their business using hate speech, offensive imagery and text, verifiably false statements and sentiments, and disparaging remarks directed toward other businesses, customers, and companies.

I urge you to revoke their liquor licenses effective immediately. Send a strong message that hate is not tolerated in the Alberta liquor industry. Please follow up with me through email or phone as to the outcome of this complaint.

Signed,
(Name)
(Address)
(Phone number)


Edit to add context and links: if you aren't [already](https://www.reddit.com/r/Edmonton/comments/13504uj/sommelier_select_liquor_going_for_a_very_specific/) [aware](https://www.reddit.com/r/Edmonton/comments/134su2f/sommelier_select_liquor_a_piece_of_shit/), the social media accounts of this business (and its owner, though I am not focusing on those) have been brought to light recently, and have several months worth of back posts for reference regarding transphobia, anti-vaccine misinformation, queer erasure, and much more including literally calling his customers and fellow Edmontonians re*ards and c*nts. I'm bringing this to the attention of the AGLC (and I hope you do too) because this is an official business account and falls under advertising, of which there are regulations to follow. 

For liquor licensees in Alberta, as per the [Licensee Handbook ](https://aglc.ca/documents/liquor-licensee-handbook) any advertising should be accurate and verifiable, within the limits of good taste and propriety (ie not offensive to the general population), and must not disparage other businesses, companies or products - these are the text of the three subsections I cited in the email template.

Again, this is not for the fact that they posted it as an individual - I may be angry about it but it's easy enough to ignore and move on - but as a business, in my industry, I can't stand for it. They're violating the terms of their license and should have it revoked. Less than that, if you are a producer or importer that has products in their shop, get them out right now. Producers that claim to stand for 2slgbtqia+ rights, don't be silent on this issue. This is the hate that we are supposed to be trying to eliminate when we say ""no hate in our industry"".",t2_egsa3,Please report Sommelier Select Liquor to AGLC,t3_1350xex,1350xex,kyonlion,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlbertaBeer/comments/1350xex/please_report_sommelier_select_liquor_to_aglc/,0.74,23,liquor,0.5990345478057861,0.1080515310168266,0.0427344255149364,0.0514358282089233,0.0302972998470067,0.0279691647738218,0.0106925684958696,0.0129600604996085,0.1041315123438835,0.0126930605620145,0.9915677309036255,0.008432222530245781

My wife ordered two kids meals for takeout from a local chain restaurant (which she picked up from the store) and in one of the meals drinks, there was liquor and a piece of metal. My child drank half the contents before I fished out the foreign object and realized that it was a mixed drink.

I contacted our local liquor control board and alerted the restaurant of what happened. They admitted the drink 1. Wasn’t in a kids cup when it should have been 2. Stated they had no cameras at the bar to validate what I was stating and 3. Sent me a few different corporate types who, in a roundabout way, asked me what it would take to make this go away.

I’ve been into tiki for about 2 years now, and now that I have a basic understanding of tiki fundamentals I’m ready to expand. 

The problem is I can never find the rums I need. I have been to several liquor stores all over Chicago, from red star in Logan to the binnys in Lincoln Park and can never seem to find staples like Clement VSOP or any appleton rums other than their youngins’

So, Chicago tiki friends, where are you sourcing your rums from locally in Chicago? 

I live in Logan Square, so if you know any good locales somewhere in the city proper- I’d love to hear um.

1433,2023-04-18 23:20:15-05:00,1681878015.0,kingdomcome,t5_2zi6m,"One morning, I was heading up to the rattay gates from Pesheks mill, and the guards at the gate arrested me for assaulting someone (the rich woman in the vagrants pickpocket missions). Rather than pay my hard won groschen for the fine, I went to jail.

Five days later, i was released from jail at 6 in the morning. Now i was due to report in to the bailiff for service, however, he was still asleep. So, i decided to eat and wait for two hours until the bailiff woke up. The only nourishment i had in my inventory was moonshine and spirits, so i drank them both and then waited two hours. 

Turns out, this was too much grog for my henry, and i passed out for a few hours. I awoke with a hangover in skalitz. I went to equip my sword, and realised i had next to no gear since all my stuff was stolen gear and had been confiscated when i was arrested. 

Of course, there were what appeared to be bandits fighting guards between me and the exit, so i waited and watched the bandits get defeated and rout. I decided to move then, but one of the routing bandits spotted me, and charged. I bolted and ran directly for the guards hoping they would protect me. 

When i got close enough, i realised they werent guards at all, just other well dressed bandits. So they turned on me as well. I ran as far as my legs could take me, and managed to get to the gate out of skalitz before i had to stop and catch my breath. Within one second, i heard shouting, and was clubbed to death instantly after that.

1435,2023-03-15 03:19:45-05:00,1678868385.0,NeutralPolitics,t5_2tk0i,"The DeSantis administration in Florida is [seeking to revoke the Hyatt Regency Miami's liquor license](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article273137760.html) due to the hosting of a Christmas-themed drag queen show, ""[A Drag Queen Christmas](https://www.dragfans.com/tour/drag-queen-christmas-2022/),"" in which minors were present. The show was held at the James L. Knight Center, a 4,500-seat auditorium affiliated with the hotel. State regulators claim that the admission policies allowed minors to attend the event, leading to their exposure to performers in ""sexually suggestive clothing and prosthetic female genitalia.""

The decision to target the Hyatt Regency Miami's liquor license has sparked debate over whether the administration's actions are legitimate enforcement of the law or a political maneuver targeting drag performances. This comes amid a [larger crackdown on drag shows](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/21/anti-drag-show-laws-bans-republican-states) that permit minors in the audience, as the Republican-led Legislature and the DeSantis administration intensify their efforts.

The legal filing can be found [here](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23707305/dbpr-complaint.pdf).

In light of this recent action and the broader crackdown on drag shows:

* Is the DeSantis administration's targeting of the Hyatt Regency Miami's liquor license a justified enforcement of existing laws?
* Are there any legal precedents or arguments supporting or opposing this action?
* In particular, what constitutional arguments are there for or against this action, especially regarding the first amendment?",t2_3f87u,Is Florida's crackdown on drag shows and the targeting of Hyatt Regency Miami's liquor license legally justified?,t3_11rq58d,11rq58d,unkz,105,https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/11rq58d/is_floridas_crackdown_on_drag_shows_and_the/,0.92,461,liquor,0.64797443151474,0.0090569118037819,0.0501957349479198,0.0537989027798175,0.0306726340204477,0.0859639048576355,0.0096889911219477,0.0090299863368272,0.0926271826028823,0.0109913414344191,0.9839684963226318,0.016031485050916672

Original post:

&amp;#x200B;

Greetings from Germany,

I wanted to ask for some recommendations for liquors that are cheap but still decent quality for the price. Of course there already are plenty of recommendations online, but unfortunately, most of them recommend the same few brands, some of which are not available in german supermarkets OR are much more expensive here than in the States for example.

I already bought some spirits based on those lists, that are available here.

For example (and feel free to share your opinions, alternatives and correct me, if you think that I'm wrong), in terms of gin I've read that Gordon's is supposed to be decent for its price, for white rum I have Bacardi's Carta Blanca Superior and Havana Club 3 Anos, for Scotch I have Famous Grouse, and finding decent Vodka is no problem at all.

Dark rum and US whiskey on the other hand are more of a problem. For example, I've read that Plantation, Rittenhouse and Old Overholt are supposed to be good. But I couldn't find them in any store.

Now obviously, many of you won't know what brands are available in Germany, but it would be immensely helpful to have some recommendations that usually aren't on those top 10 budget liquors lists you can find online.

I would greatly apprecate your help, thanks for reading!",t2_635uw02fm,Budget liquors that are still decent?

On the up side, the lady at the liquor store was glad to see me and told me she hadn't seen me in a while. I plain told her I had developed alcoholism and I hadn't been to a liquor store since December. She completely understood and after check-out she asked if they would be seeing me again. I told her I don't know and that maybe every couple of months to buy NA drinks.

She then told me that most of her customers are alcoholics and very few people own it, and the fact that I recognized it and did something about it, I had her respect. This is an old biker no-nonsense lady, and I can tell her respect is not easy to come by. So that was pretty cool.  

It was hard. Really hard. Fuck liquor stores.

Ingredients:

Gentian Root (large pieces): 20 g

Coffee Beans 3g

Ceylon Cinnamon Stick: 2g

Bay Leaf: 1

Fresh Lemon Peel: 5g

Macerate all ingredients for 40 days in 500g of white wine (I used 2021 Kirkland Pinot Grigio).

Strain out ingredients.

Add 150g GNS (95% ABV)

Add 100g cooled simple syrup (from 100g distilled water + 100g sugar)

Let rest for a few days and bottle. 750g of approximately 30% ABW (if I'm doing the math correct it should be close).

Taste: Bracingly but pleasantly bitter with gentian being the overwhelming flavor note followed by a sweet lemony tang and some cinnamon on the back of the tongue. You can't really taste the coffee beans or the bay leaf. Maybe that changes as it rests in the bottle. I really like it and it's already starting to get more subtle after a couple of weeks.

This was the recipe I used: [https://www.terredibenessere.com/en/caramanico-popoli/benessere-gusto-caramanico-popoli/recipeliquoredigenziana-89](https://www.terredibenessere.com/en/caramanico-popoli/benessere-gusto-caramanico-popoli/recipeliquoredigenziana-89). Thanks to r/RookieRecurve for the inspiration.

(I wish I was a bit better at taking pictures. I'll try to up my game.)

I think Charley may be responsible for her death in some way. While the show seems to be pointing the finger at Xavior and Mr. Anderson are both obvious suspects, but they don't explain the unusual circumstances surrounding Maddie, as a ghost. They are definitely both shady, but I don't know about being capable of murder. For example, we've been told that Rhonda, one of the other ghosts, was murdered by her guidance counselor. Rhonda has not been shown to have been able to communicate with any living person. Maddie is the only one confirmed so far. In fact, all other other ghosts get very interested at the very suggestion of this happening, but Charley is constantly discouraging Maddie from telling the rest of them. In fact, he's been the most vocal about her moving on and not thinking about her death. While the rest of the group also seems to share this same view, Charley is also shown to be a major contributor to the group. Perhaps he helped form the support group to begin with.  He claims that it's best for her to accept that she is dead and not worry about how she died. Even at an extreme end a murder investigation shouldn't take a long time. He's been there since the 90s. What's exactly the rush to find acceptance? He is also quick to dismiss the fact the Maddie is apparently the first ghost to not remember how she died. Why isn't the rest of the group curious about this? Are they trying to hide something?

They also mention in the first episode someone had recently moved onto the great beyond, after being there since the 60s. Could this be related to Maddie suddenly dying since it's so close in timing? Originally Charley says maybe this is just about going in an out, but he is later confirmed to be wrong about this. We now know that Maddie can only communicate with Simon in places where someone has died. This wouldn't be suspicious on its own since Maddie is supposedly the first case of being able to talk to the living, but at the end of the first episode/beginning of the second episode Simon sees Maddie, but not Charley. All other episodes only show Maddie and Simon without any other ghosts. Notice where everyone is standing when Simon sees Maddie in the classroom. Maddie is beside Simon, by the window, but Charley is by the doorway. Could this mean that Charley knew about the room and being able to communicate, but didn't want to show himself. Also, we're told that the dead can't impact the living in any way, but how does the distinction between animate and inanimate objects work? The ghosts can duplicate inanimate objects, but not animate objects (or so we've been told). This has actually not been shown on screen yet.

Think about it, it has this narrative that you are somehow not good enough. You are inherently evil and filthy. You are worthy of burning in hell forever, and never worthy of more. You are worthless, and god is so good so nice he supposedly loves your filthy, worthless, untouchable, unlovable self. However, if you worship him and chant out loud that you are worthless, you MIGHT not have to burn for eternity. That's if you worship him and submit to him good enough. Still not a free ticket to heaven! The gate is narrow! So if you don't completely monitor and prevent every filthy thought and go against literal psychology and nature you burn. This is honestly disheartening to hear and probably not the best thing to tell children. What is the objective of this? To ruin self esteems and to crush spirits so people don't fight back? Christianity is also extremely pushy, walking into a church is like walking into a car dealership. They are around you like sharks trying to get you to buy the beliefs they are selling. They want to rule the world and love bragging about how many people they converted! Christianity like other religions has a hierarchy.

1517,2023-04-29 02:07:57-05:00,1682752077.0,Eldenring,t5_122hf1,"I keep seeing video essays on Elden Ring bosses criticizing the boss design for essentially being overwhelming and not like dark souls. Bloodborne and ds3 bosses are typically fetishized as good examples of what Elden Ring should be more like.

The problem is all of these players refuse to use spirit ashes!!! WHY? It is a core game mechanic. The bosses are designed around it. The boss has a teammate because you have a teammate dude. Spirit ashes don't tune up the bosses like summons do, or open you up to invasions for a reason.

I am so exhausted by soulsborne players playing Elden Ring as a challenge run then blaming the game design for it being unfairly challenging.

EDIT: I want to address the main counters to what im saying and the confusion I feel some people have with the point I am making.

I don't like spirit summons, they are gimmicky and they get old imo. I am not here to say Elden Ring boss fights are perfect or the best in the series. I have played and beaten every fromsoft game with the exception of demon souls and armored core, relax with the elitism.

Spirit summons are a core mechanic. It is shoved in your face constantly if you didnt figure it out thats kinda on you. Like half of the world dungeons are for glovewart and ashes ffs. Whether something is a core mechanic or not has nothing to do with how well the game explicitly tells the player it is core.

The point I am making is that bosses ESPECIALLY DUOS are designed around and scaled based on the fact that you have spirit ashes. Its not an ""easy mode."" Playing without them is hard mode/a challenge run. You are intentionally restricting yourself from using one of your most powerful tools. Life gems are dumb too, but no one is surprised it makes ds2 harder when you dont use them. If you want to tough it out anyway have fun. If you wish that Elden Ring didnt even have spirit ashes, and all the bosses were tuned for solo fights in mind I understand and might agree. Thats just not the game we are dealing with. Criticize the ashes as a mechanic then, not the bosses for just existing in a game where ashes are important.

I take issues with criticisms of the bosses that can be easily be resolved by just using spirit ashes. The boss duo you're fighting is overwhelming you and its unfair? Well yes of course it is you handicapped yourself. You're doing a challenge run. Those are hard.

EDIT 2:

A lot of people are getting hung up with the ""core mechanic"" or ""designed around"" part of it which I sort of understand. You can beat the game without them, and you might not even have much trouble with bosses without them depending on how you play. But you can also beat the game without torrent, or without jumping. These are still core mechanics that the devs and a lot of the world is built around them. Ashes are the same way (gloveword oriented dungeons, the sheer number of ashes found as treasure, big groups of enemies in the world, world puzzles use them, boss duos, etc)

Okay but what about in boss fights specifically? I say they are designed around the ashes not because I think that ashes are seamlessly integrated into every fight, but because the game expects you to use them in the fights. Health and damage is scaled accordingly. I would say the ashes fit in particularly well in duo bosses. Fighting duos without ashes if frustrating. Ashes also fit in well with world bosses that have other enemies around, or with bosses that have multiple difficult phases.

Im still having a fun time discussing this, the community here seems pretty chill. &lt;3",t2_kciarotc,Spirit ashes are a core part of boss game design and people act like they aren't.,t3_132lxe7,132lxe7,Brickchomp,848,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/132lxe7/spirit_ashes_are_a_core_part_of_boss_game_design/,0.87,1955,spirits,0.119791992008686,0.0512996837496757,0.1759003400802612,0.0451058968901634,0.0981055572628974,0.1806080043315887,0.0434235483407974,0.0658492818474769,0.1702347546815872,0.0496809743344783,0.20373152196407318,0.7962684631347656

The game is gorgeous and runs beautifully on the PS5. Deep, vibrant colors and a super cute art-style genuinely make this one to behold. The fluid animations really show off the devs background in traditional studio animation.

It's not open world, which is a great change for a change (I'm truly burnt out on open world games at this point). Instead you explore a section of the map at a time. There are lots of little secrets and collectibles to find, and not all of them are cosmetic. Each area has several boss fight, but more on that later.

There is a not-overwhelming skill tree which you unlock along the way to give you combat skills and buffs. Nothing too fancy but it feels just right for this game. Your sidekicks, the rots, also can give you a hand in combat, which makes them worth finding in the world.

The soundtrack is truly fantastic, mixing the usual orchestral motivs with world music instrumentation and vocals. Fits the vibe perfectly.

But let's talk about an unexpected high point, the combat. I had heard about the tough encounters but I still wasn't prepared for some of these fights. Even a few of the non-boss encounters were legit tough, and the bosses are no joke. What I really like about the combat here is that it kinda ""forces"" you to engage with the various mechanics in play. Staff melee, bow, bomb throwing, dashing, dodging, zip-lining, etc. If you rely on one type of attack you'll get punished. A couple of the encounters I only got through because I started changing up my playstyle. While it's still not quite on par with Souls combat (hit registration is lacking, for one), it was an unexpected treat to have to think outside the box.

Negatives? Not too many, really. The story is pretty lackluster, the typical our village is dying and only you can save it. The campaign length was perfect (spent about 15 hours with it). Overall a solid 8!",t2_7doxdc9s,Kena: Bridge of Spirits - when you need Toy Story graphics AND Dark Souls' bosses.,t3_13aqm6m,13aqm6m,Representative-Yam65,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/13aqm6m/kena_bridge_of_spirits_when_you_need_toy_story/,0.93,147,spirits,0.0680721178650856,0.0345976762473583,0.7720474600791931,0.0186131950467824,0.0141117218881845,0.0332919135689735,0.0134895471855998,0.0088737038895487,0.0220386013388633,0.0148640237748622,0.9640965461730957,0.03590346872806549

Maybe if they could be crushed for a small amount of mining BXP or if we somehow made most resource drops require stone spirits to ""refine' into a useable form we might see stone spirits be actually worthwhile to all but the most desperate of 120 smithing aspirants and yak track miners... but as of right now they're just the worst drop on any drop table.

There is a ""Communicate With Us"" page on Spirit's website which I've found is completely ignored. But I turned it into a cathartic space to document all the holds and calls and chats with remarkably impotent people that have happened over the last 41 hours. For any wheelchair users that might find it useful or entertaining, here it is:

 

* 05-02-2023 08:00 PM  
I'm in a wheelchair, kind of afraid of flying because my worst fear is that my wheelchair will be damaged. There's a process to recovering lost baggage. It's not pleasant but it exists. You lost my wheelchair. You didn't lose my baggage. You lost my wheelchair. I haven't been able to walk for six years. Not only is it humiliating to not be able to leave an airplane and be the last one waiting while everyone says you can't find my wheelchair, but also physically uncomfortable and an amazing loss of my independence. It doesn't just affect me, but my whole family of 4 that was with me and had to basically turn me into a piece of luggage and wheel me from place to place. I couldn't even wheel myself! Your transport wheelchairs don't allow for that. The wheelchair was supposed to be waiting for me to transfer into at the gate. That's your job. You failed at it. You left it in Las Vegas! I expect to be compensated for my loss of independence, for my humiliation, for my physical discomfort, for the ruination of my family's experience while you assumingly locate my wheelchair and return it to me. My low-ball estimation of what you owe me are two free round-trip tickets to las vegas and back. Even with that, I would hesitate to use you ever again, I'm nervous about even flying again, because you have managed to bring my worst flight nightmare into being.  

* 📷
* 05-03-2023 06:47 PM  
I have yet to receive my wheelchair. I have yet to receive information from you about where it is. It takes 6-8 weeks to have a wheelchair built for me (it's a piece of medical equipment for me, not off-the-shelf). I didn't even imagine that you actually lost it! I may also file a complaint with the Department of Transportation Airline Division under disability discrimination if this isn't resolved really fast. Right now you're treating my wheelchair need as if I just lost a piece of luggage. I am now house bound because of you and can't travel outside my house without a wheelchair.

* 05-03-2023 08:20 PM  
I'm currently on hold with your bag claim number at 678-973-2402. I've been on hold with them before and at 17 minutes am sent to voicemail. I've left voicemail. I'm currently waiting to decide whether to send a complaint to the Disability division of the Office of Aviation Consumer Protection. I have a letter waiting to send. I've heard nothing productive from you yet, and am running out of patience and options.

* 05-03-2023 08:56 PM  
I've now called 855-728-3555, and after 9 minutes on hold was just hung up on. I'm redialing and am now on hold waiting again. If you can't find my wheelchair, then we need to find a solution fast. You've broken my legs and are treating it like a lost suitcase.

I'm now speaking to Marlin, who has taken all my information, made me restate all the reasons I'm calling without looking up my documented problem first. After finally looking it up, he is putting me on hold for two minutes to write down extensive notes before handing me over to his supervisor. Let's see how that goes....  

* 📷
* 05-03-2023 09:15 PM  
Marlin did not know the name of the supervisor he was transferring me to, telling me that there are several supervisors at that level, but he has now done so and I'm listening to more hold music, but a different composer...

It's been seven minutes more on hold to a supervisor. The hold music and what the voice on hold says doesn't make it seem like I'm on a special hold for a supervisor, but who am I to say. Hope it doesn't hang up on me after 17 minutes like the other... Maureen answered! And says she's a supervisor! Made me repeat myself again without looking at my file. Then asked for my file ID number and has put me on hold yet again.  

* 📷
* 05-03-2023 09:29 PM  
We're now at 42 minutes and 45 seconds on this call  

* 📷
* 05-03-2023 09:30 PM  
But I haven't been hung up on. I guess that's a positive.  

* 📷
* 05-03-2023 09:52 PM  
Well, that didn't go well. Maureen told us that all the information she could provide us was that the wheelchair hasn't been located. She did say I shouldn't have left the airport without a replacement wheelchair, and that she understood that no wheelchair had been available. She did say that my only recompense was to drive the 45 minutes to Detroit airport, go to the Spirit desk, and wait for a possible, unguaranteed replacement. Told me, the person who cannot walk, to get back to Detroit from Ypsilanti. She also said that she had no way of helping further, had no manager above her that could help, but to go to spirit.com/help -- and then said goodbye  

* 📷
* 05-03-2023 10:02 PM  
So, I'll take her advice and go over to spirit.com/help. After filling out the information it asked for, it's now telling me that there will be about a 20 minute wait before a representative will attend to me. Here we go...  

* 📷
* 05-03-2023 10:28 PM  
Certainly not just a 20 minute wait. Still waiting...  

* 📷
* 05-03-2023 10:40 PM  
Not even a 30 minute wait. Still waiting on chat... but at least I know, ""We have received your message. You are currently in queue and your message will be answered in the order it was received.""  

* 📷
* 05-03-2023 10:59 PM  
Wow! I'm approaching the one hour mark on hold in the chat queue at spirit.com/help -- so absurd!  

* 📷
* 05-03-2023 11:09 PM  
It was only two hours ago that I was speaking with Marlin, but that was three phone numbers ago and a website. Hard to believe that I've spent the last 120 minutes pursuing this with no end in sight. I can't give up though, you currently have my ability to move around in the world lost somewhere in your system  

* 📷
* 05-03-2023 11:12 PM  
Supposedly, you have to offer me a replacement if you don't have my wheelchair when I come off the plane. At least, that's what Maureen said you have to do according to federal regulations. But that might be for D.O.T. to decide.  

* 📷
* 05-03-2023 11:29 PM  
Whew, now we're at the point where I feel like a fool for waiting in queue any longer, but I have no where else to go for recompense. I guess I keep waiting even though it's now been 87 minutes  

* 📷
* 05-03-2023 11:48 PM  
How do I know if I'm being lied to by a computer? It tells me I'm in queue every time I ask it. But now it's been 106 minutes  

* 📷
* 05-04-2023 12:04 AM  
There's the two hour wait mark  

* 📷
* 05-04-2023 12:10 AM  
I'm sleepy. But there is no way I am losing my place in this queue. If there's a two hour wait right now, what's the wait going to be when even more people are trying to chat with you. I'm so stuck right now with no good choices.

Since no one ever responds to any message in this particular space, I have to start assuming that this space is just here for the self-cleansing act of sharing my journey through this harrowing process. Oh, yeah, and I still don't have my independence or mobility because of you.

Amber is still searching evidently. No word from her in the last ten minutes.  

* 📷
* 05-04-2023 01:00 AM  
Wow!  
Amber - Okay. Me (20 minutes later) I'm not trying to be rude, I'm just curious if you're still working on this. We have received your message. You are currently in queue and your message will be answered in the order it was received. You’ve been placed in line to chat with a representative. Your expected wait is 40 minutes.  
I guess Amber just left

Maureen's idea of going to Sprint.com/help did not work. They finally just ended the conversation abruptly. ""We apologize for the extended delay.

Ok. Had some sleep. I'll try the only suggestion I have left again, Maureen's suggestion of sprint.com/help. RIght now, you say a 20 minute wait. We all know what that turned into last night, nearly 4 hours and then being thrown out of the queue. Here we go...

Oh! An Anna Liza just started typing in my chat window and then disappeared. Now it says my expected wait time is 1 minute. Did Anna Liza go away?  

* 📷
* 05-04-2023 12:47 PM  
Here we go. I'm in contact with someone who I assume is human. The name is Anna Liza, though they say their name is Liezel. I wish us both good luck with this!  

* 📷
* 05-04-2023 12:54 PM  
Anna Liza hasn't thrown me back to the queue yet, that's a good sign. And has come back with two reassurances that they are still reviewing the situation. I admit there's a bit to review.  

* 📷
* 05-04-2023 01:27 PM  
Whoops. Anna Liza said this page was my only recourse. But then has slipped me over to another agent named Angel  

* 📷
* 05-04-2023 01:40 PM  
So Angel has no idea about how to help me and just says that they can't help me on this chat. I need to click the ""communicate with us"" option on this page. (We see how much that gets answered.) They also provided me two NEW phone numbers for Baggage Office Number 787-253-3760 or 678-973-2402 (vBSO)

* 05-04-2023 01:43 PM

* 05-04-2023 01:53 PM  
Angel is ""truly sorry"" that they can't help me and has recommended I try the first number he gave me first.

My wife and I have had some struggles and now it's come to this: every time we fight, she talks about demons and spirits, that I have a demon in me or spirits. And now it's in her discourse about a lot of things too like how some people who commit some sins are essentially inviting spirits into their lives. There's a lot about sorcery too, it's a common theme.

She wasn't having this kind of talk before. And its something I can look beyond and brush to the side maybe, but we have a young baby, we're raising her Christian, hopefully something softcore but I seem to be having very little sway over that. And I don't want my baby daughter to just think and talk in terms of spirits and demons all the time as she grows up. That's not the kind of adult I want to raise.

During a calmer moment, I asked my wife where she learned all this, if it was in Bible school or with former pastors. She remained vague and said something about having researched this and also yes, former pastors.

anywho, frequently i have dreams of ghosts. i dream that i’d be moving into a new home… my biggest worry is moving into a haunted home. and in the home is the same spirit(s) calling out to me. i can feel in the dreams that it’s them, or supposed to be. they’re not hurting me, they’re just there. appearing and disappearing, moving things. always watching and listening. the concept freaks me out. in other dreams, they’re just flashbacks of what i directly experienced in my old house. maybe things from their point of view… it gives me anxiety. they’re not as intense as nightmares but it’s uncomfortable. is something trying to communicate with me, or am i just trying to make sense out of it? do i sound crazy",t2_u24g734z,do you believe that spirits can enter our dreams?,t3_13ac8k8,13ac8k8,cyndoom,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/13ac8k8/do_you_believe_that_spirits_can_enter_our_dreams/,0.89,57,spirits,0.0896475166082382,0.0454042963683605,0.0647294968366622,0.0402872115373611,0.0764040946960449,0.3478876948356628,0.0737382695078849,0.0822269022464752,0.1359066665172577,0.0437678806483745,0.5595541000366211,0.4404459297657013

I think it is weird the avatar spirit would show off without the presence of the actual avatar. 

I wonder, Zuko is a descendant of Roku, and it has a repercution on his mind or ""spirit"" as good versus evil are fighting inside of him.

It is possible Suki is a descendant of Kyoshi, and her also being a Kyoshi warrior sort of unlock the possibility for Suki to have a special connection with Kyoshi? 

It would be interesting for blood related persons with an Avatar to have a special connection with them. It would be for the most part irrelevant and useless to most people, but Suki being both blood related and spiritual connection with Kyoshi could be enough for Kyoshi to manifest!

1588,2023-05-07 14:15:33-05:00,1683486933.0,Yellowjackets,t5_j07gx,"Hey fellow Yellowjackets fans! I just finished watching the latest episodes of Season 2, and I have a theory that I believe adds a new level of depth and mystery to the show. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this!

My theory revolves around Lottie and her therapist. I believe that the therapist isn't actually real, but rather a manifestation of Lottie's subconscious, or even the ""forest"" itself, trying to guide her in some way. This may sound far-fetched at first, but hear me out.

First off, the clothing choices of Lottie and the therapist seem to be quite symbolic. In their first encounter, both were wearing white, signifying purity and innocence. In their latest session, both were wearing red, which typically represents danger, passion, or even a warning. This color transition could suggest that Lottie's mental state is gradually changing, or that the forest's influence is growing stronger.

It seems that Lottie is shaken by the presence of Misty and the other, and I believe this has a deeper meaning. My theory is that the forest spirit is intentionally reuniting the survivors one by one.

Why would the forest spirit do this? Perhaps the survivors' connection to the forest is far from over, and their shared experiences in the woods have left them with unresolved emotional and spiritual ties. The spirit could be trying to guide them back together in order to resolve those issues, or maybe even to fulfill some kind of prophecy.

Lottie's encounters with her therapist, as I mentioned, could be a manifestation of her subconscious or even the forest spirit itself. This further supports the idea that the forest is working to reunite the survivors and influence their actions, both in the past and present.

It's also interesting to note that the show has depicted the forest as a living entity, almost like a character in its own right. The presence of a forest spirit adds a supernatural element to the story, emphasizing the idea that there might be forces beyond human understanding at play in the characters' lives.

While it's true that Lottie isn't ""crazy"" in the traditional sense, her experiences in the forest might have left her with a fractured sense of reality. The show has consistently blurred the lines between reality and fantasy, leaving viewers questioning what's real and what's imagined. Lottie's therapist could be another example of this narrative ambiguity, further emphasizing the show's theme of psychological turmoil and the impact of traumatic events on the mind.

So, what do you think of this theory? Could the therapist really be a figment of Lottie's imagination, or even the forest's attempt at manipulation? Or am I reading too much into the details? I'd love to hear your thoughts and opinions! Let's discuss in the comments below!

**Update:**

I think the promo confirms my theory that the therapist is in Lottie's mind [0:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WD_bS3q7vW0&amp;t=18s) (Spoilers) &gt;!You can see the antler queen in the office.!&lt;

**Update #2:**

Thinking about it, could be that the spirt is ""Gaia"", an earth/nature spirit that has the ability to control the bodies of Earthlings (Biokinesis), either through harm or transfiguration. 

**See my new Gaia theory:** [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Yellowjackets/comments/13aztpo/season_2_the_therapist_is_in_lotties_mind_the/)

All the cursed spirits were a means to an end in the series. Even the main vilian group in the first few story arcs were just kenjakus pawns he planned on absorbing later. 

I just find it interesting that this is the direction gege went with this story when it was really easy to make it about sorcerers vs curses. But instead, he opted to move into the infighting direction with sorcerers vs sorcerers. With cursed spirits being a means to an end. 

I really like how he handled it though. It's like these sorcerers are so strong the curses aren't a problem anymore, it's the other sorcerers. 

But I do miss the exorcist feeling the series kind of had near its start. I feel like a lot of people have forgotten these guys are exorcists. All the yokai and ghost stories in japan in this timeline are just cursed spirits that got a name and folklore. However, the story took a turn for more battle-oriented themes. 

And it's a shame cause when gege does go for the occult themes and horror themes, he does them very very well. 

Like technically Gojos performance in Shibuya was a mass exorcism, but it just feels weird saying that because it felt like a hero vs monsters.",t2_2f8gmb,The threat and themes of Cursed Spirits in Jujutsu Kaisen,t3_137jhe7,137jhe7,SuperDuperTino,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jujutsushi/comments/137jhe7/the_threat_and_themes_of_cursed_spirits_in/,0.99,115,spirits,0.3929625153541565,0.0539357997477054,0.0536104701459407,0.0663768202066421,0.0829712375998497,0.091805025935173,0.0662871524691581,0.0637369975447654,0.0855900421738624,0.0427239723503589,0.8716771602630615,0.1283228099346161

I only saw him in pictures. My mom would only tell stories about him that I could not relate into. I would often wonder what it felt having a father, until When I was about 3 or 4 years old, i distinctly remember running around our small house and playing by myself. I remember stopping every now and then to catch my breath. I was fascinated by my newfound observation that my chest would rise and fall as I take a deep breath from all the running i was making. After catching up my breath, I resume with my game, running, stopping and then running again. In the middle of my stop, I was caught off guard by something familiar. I saw my father, he was tall, wears a blue and white stripe polo shirt and is smiling broadly at me, then he  lowers his body and seems to be beckoning me to come close to him so that he could lift me up. While this was happening, i vividly remembered thinking ""oh i thought he was already dead, why was he here?"" for a fraction of a second i forgot he was dead and immediately ran to him for a hug, as i was nearing him, his image disappeared. I never felt scared on that moment and when I look around and realized he was not there, I resume with my play. I later told my mom what I saw and as I was describing what happened, her tears is falling down her cheeks, I never understood why she was crying, but I knew what i saw and I felt happy that I saw my father at that moment..Now, 25 years later, that memory never left me and I am glad that I saw him one last time when my memory was more vivid to remember things.",t2_ai4ah00mm,Can children really see ghosts/dead people/spirits?,t3_136e2oq,136e2oq,UrTheAssh0l3,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/136e2oq/can_children_really_see_ghostsdead_peoplespirits/,0.96,112,spirits,0.0558788292109966,0.0307190176099538,0.0682250931859016,0.0485728904604911,0.0641946867108345,0.4253164827823639,0.058500338345766,0.051367986947298,0.1654851287603378,0.0317395329475402,0.3511926233768463,0.6488074064254761

I'm enjoying the switch of style, I put a lot of research into each chapter (recently I was looking into the currency in the 1850s as well as the schooling system to make it credible) and I've even plotted the whole story from the beginning to finish (something I had not previously bothered about too much) to make sure it's all cohesive and leave clues along the way for the reader. What bugs me is the little response I got, despite dropping a post about it in two HP-related groups on Facebook. 

While I don't consider myself a great writer, I thought the story is decent enough and I've earnestly endeavoured to keep the balance between the elements of mystery, intrigue, romance, suspense and a little humor. 

My heroine (Hermione) is a spirited girl and the story is written with 1st narrative, sort of patterned after Jane Eyre.

Right now the story, which has been up for a month and currently counts about 10k words, has garnered only over 300 views, several kudos and comments and I can't help but doubt whether it was worth posting in the first place.

When I finish editing I am so excited and happy with what I created (though obviously there are parts that could have always been written better), then I post and wait and after a few days of little traction and reader interaction doubts begin to overtake me and I am not sure if there's any point in continuing.

I love writing for writing's sake but oh, validation is something my spirit craves, too!",t2_7kxe7fnm8,How not to let the small number of kudos and comments dampen your spirits?,t3_134r8zw,134r8zw,SunflowerPen,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/134r8zw/how_not_to_let_the_small_number_of_kudos_and/,0.89,50,spirits,0.0615681409835815,0.0503865480422973,0.0828699544072151,0.0999019369482994,0.0859174951910972,0.1983952522277832,0.0619971007108688,0.2062150835990905,0.10733612626791,0.045412290841341,0.5908015966415405,0.4091983437538147

We were at the bottom of the league last year. We went from that to 3rd in the conference. That’s pretty insane. 

We’ve got some young, amazing talent on the team. Some of which aren’t even old enough to drink yet. We’re going to be good for a very long time with this core. 

We made it further this year than anyone would have expected. 

Sure the team is getting beat down a bit right now. I expect us to win a game or two but I don’t see us making it past Carolina. But this experience is what makes young players into seasoned vets. This experience is valuable for them. 

Next season we’re going to come back hopefully bigger/more physical and be even better than this season. 

(I’m not writing the team off yet, we were down bad against NYR and look what happened - just thinking optimistically given how well Carolina is playing) 

And no matter what - we sent NYR home in round 1! After they spent all that $ on superstars.

I have enough in savings to be able to not work for a while. But that got me thinking, do I really need to get a good paying career?

I wouldn't recommend wasting your time. I've been wanting to remake that for the longest time, but was always distracted by other things IRL...

... and then someone decided his franchise wasn't dead anymore (I'm so looking forward to New World of Steam, I haven't been this hyped for a game in years), and that was the motivation I needed to finally get this thing out the door.

Now, I'm not the most seasoned SI player - I only got my own copy after I decided I had to jump in on the NI crowdfunding campaign. But while I'm looking forward to trying out a lot of the spirits that have already come out, so many of the new spirits just seem to sparkle with exciting potential. 

Of course, the Incarna spirits. I mean, that's the big new thing. But the other four spirits also look so fun to try out. 

* **Ember- Eyed Behemoth** looks like an enjoyable romp at a managable level of complexity. Not the one I'm most excited about, but I bet it's satisfying to stomp around the island as a huge turtle. 
* **Towering Roots of the Jungle** I'm a bit unsure about - I like the idea of creating a sanctuary where nobody is fighting, though it might be frustrating that you can't so easily reach the corners of the board.
* **Breath of Darkness Down Your Spine** is one of the one I'm really looking forward to. Abducting explorers to a strange place that is everywhere and nowhere? Abducting your friends for fun and profit? Moving things around the island while slowly strangling pesky explorers? Yes please!
* **Wandering Voice Keens Delirium** will have us wandering around the island spreading madness and infighting. Sounds like fun to me!
* **Hearth-Vigil** will have you beefing up Dahan to a potent force to be reconed with. Yes please!
* **Relentless Gaze of the Sun** has you as the potent, destructive force of the sun. You'll be destroying your own presence - only to get it right back. You'll be ignoring big parts of the map, only to pound the places where you are. Sounds like a really fun one, particularly together with a more protective companion or two. 
* **Wounded Waters Bleeding** leans into the transformative aspect of the spirits. Your spirit will be transforming throughout the game! Not my immediate favourite, but I could see myself having a lot of fun with that one. 
* **Dances Up Earthquakes** makees my brain melt just by thinking about it - and I can't wait to try it out! The timing looks like such a lovely puzzle to work out. 

If I had to pick a top three, it would probably be Hearth-Vigil, Dances and Breath of Darkness. But most of them are towards the top of which spirits I'm excited to play in general!

What about you?

Im back again and after more thoughts I decided that BB58 would be a better choice ( see previous post ) but after thinking again about the concept of getting one for everyday daily wear in the future. Long spirit 37 specifically blue dial on bracelet comes to mind

Again love the look of the Tudor BB58 and particularly the black and gold version with that red triangle fits so perfectly. It’s something to do with diver’s watch that seems so elegant 

I saw the long spirit 37 the dial was it for me, i felt the zulu time was abit much and very striking but this model made it simpler yet so class

I wanted a more everyday watch to celebrate an end of a 2yr gruesome work bond and im stuck inbetween these two for choice.

1690,2023-05-08 03:41:31-05:00,1683535291.0,DMAcademy,t5_3f611,"I'm DMing a long politics/scheming-based low-fantasy campaign, where one player is a noble who oversees a naval expedition. Basically, think conquistadores. The Sun has not moved for centuries, so the whole continent is slowly turning into desert. Everyone blames it on wizards. Now, the Noble is sent by Emperor to unite 3 different armies (Necromancers, xenophobe mountainmen and goblin horde) that all hate each other, form a fleet and set off to a new prosperous land.

At the very first session, this Noble PC meets a mysterious cat creature. He somehow rolls nat 20 and makes contact with it. The cat tells them to find a desert spirit, perform what it will wish for and then the Noble would receive unfathomable power. The Noble agrees and keeps it a secret from other players. 

---

A few sessions later, players finally meet said spirit. They go to secluded stables to get a carriage and meet a stable master lady. She (NPC) successfully seduces one of the PCs, a useless decadent Prosecutor (this player earlier told me they wanted to make a new character, so death is OK). After Prosecutor agrees to get into bed, stable master turns out to be an evil Jinn and starts attacking the Prosecutor to steal their skin. 

The Noble attacks the Jinn, then receives information that Jinn is the desert spirit they were looking for. Now Noble is faced with a choice: let the Jinn kill the Prosecutor and receive a reward, or fight a boss enemy and keep their friend alive. Of course, the Noble chooses the former and everyone collectively drags out the Prosecutor into the desert. Prosecutor gets flayed alive by the Jinn and disappears into the dunes.

---

And now, the question is, how would I reward them for it? In the context of the story, desert spirits were able to command winds, animals and sand 

My first idea is that the sacrificed character would come back as an NPC Terracotta army general, leading a legion of undead soldiers who don't eat, don't talk and don't want anything other than serving the party. This would contribute to campaign goals of mustering a force and sailing away. But how would the world react to such a sight? At the moment of sacrifice, the party had 3 guards accompanying them. These guards (undisclosed to players) were spies from the mountainmen faction which utterly hates magic, so it would make sense for them to desert and for 1 of the 3 original armies to turn against the party, which pushes players to be on the side of undead/spirits/bandits/evil afterwards. 

But that doesn't seem like much of a reward, does it?

&gt; The spell will trigger from one of the Triggerbots, Manifesting two Dervishes and disabling your weapons. The spell cannot then trigger a second time because you no longer have that spell, so it fails to trigger from the second triggerbot's location.

&gt; Because the spell only creates two minions and does not deal any damage, the damage penalty on the passive skill that grants the triggerbots has no interaction with this skill. 

This wording implies that the only reason we don't get 4 dervishes is because the first trigger removes the weapon. This isn't the case for [spectral spirits](https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Spectral_Spirits), which simply triggers when equipping the essenced weapon. Thus, triggerbots would allow us to get 6 spectral spirits instead of 3.

Spectral spirits are always at the verge of being decent. They're a very interesting minion: immortal, fast, fast hitting, and can be affected by 6 support skills. Their drawback is their low base damage.

So, sure, we can get 6 of those, but... On saboteur? Why would you want to do that on an ascendancy that has nothing to do with minions? Well... Enter pyroclast mine:

&gt; Each Mine Adds (1-12) to (2-18) Fire Damage to Hits against Enemies near it, up to a maximum of (64-601) to (96-901)

With enough investment in mine aura effect (which the sabo gets in spades) and levels on a corrupted Victario's influence, this supplies more than enough base damage to carry the minion.

So the plan is to alternate casting minefield + swift + pyroclast, and on another setup high impact mine + minefield + SRS + feeding frenzy for some more minion support (note that high impact mine provides chance to double damage). We'd never actually detonate the mines, just leave them there for the aura.

Here's an [extremely rough](https://pobb.in/yYIyVP1NP8CQ) PoB for the idea. It's missing most of the gear, it's level 100, and probably has nonsense config enabled, but it's just to explore the general shape of the build.

And yeah, Vorana's is a total meme but I think it's funny that you get six of them, plus they can intimidate and expose, so there's that.

This is the first game from Ember Lab, an animation studio known for some short films and commercials. Coming from this background, the visuals are very good. 

The gameplay consists of platforming and combat with some puzzles. You also control small creatures call rot that you discover along the way. They reminded me of Nintendo's Pikmin. You can have them perform various tasks and as your abilites progress they assist in combat too.  

You start out with a staff for combat with normal and strong attacks but later you gain other abilities such as turning the staff into a bow and bombs to throw at your opponents. Combat was fast and fun though not a lot of variation over the course of the game other than using new abilities.   

The platforming was very good with tight controls. I was never frustrated with it like I have been in some games where your moves had to be perfect. 

It took me about 18 hours to beat the game though How Long To Beat shows half  that for the main game, though I often seem to have times longer than they show. 

If you want a beautiful looking game with fun gameplay, I highly recommend this game.",t2_j8lls,Kena: Bridge of Spirits,t3_11tqy3k,11tqy3k,Zoraji,129,https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/11tqy3k/kena_bridge_of_spirits/,0.95,431,spirits,0.3104853928089142,0.1158378347754478,0.2006492763757705,0.0670716762542724,0.0477827228605747,0.1526505649089813,0.0234429948031902,0.0115006826817989,0.0433564558625221,0.0272224135696887,0.9952650666236877,0.00473496550694108

Rewind back to 2017, a few weeks before the first match ever, I was working the closing shift as an assistant manager at a dominos in the Marietta area. I had just finished my last carry out order probably 20 minutes prior and locked the front door and turned off the open sign. As I start cleaning, I see a red blur walk up to the door and wave at me. At first I’m like, oh my god we are CLOSED for carry out! Leave me alone! But as I got closer to the door I see that there are three guys wearing Atlanta United training kits. I didn’t recognize them at all. So I let them in and out of curiosity I asked if they were on the first team. One of them said they were, in very broken English. 

Those three guys were LGP, Tito Villalba, and Yamil Asad. They were so extremely nice, and stepped up to the make line to watch me make their pizzas (they ordered and ate a large specialty pizza EACH to themselves) and took a picture with me after they got done eating. 

After that personal interaction with players on the team, I got super pumped to go watch these pro soccer players play for Atlanta’s new MLS team, and I’ve been a massive fan ever since. LGP continued to come into my store after carry out closed with his wife and brother-in-law every once in a while and he never paid for a single pie for him and his family, and sat and had a conversation with me about the season every time he came in.


Just thought I’d share this special memory with you all.

I've finally managed to complete my first pioneer deck which is mono blue spirits, but am not familiar with the appropriate way of Sideboarding against different matchups and what to replace with what (Sometimes it feels wrong to replace a creature with removal/protection). Here is my decklist:

[https://www.archidekt.com/decks/4479616](https://www.archidekt.com/decks/4479616)

In the Maybeboard are cards that I have available that I can replace other cards with if they would work better. I personally think Test of Talents might have a home.

Fortunately I've also played a few weeks at my FNM and have an idea of what each person plays which I can summarize here for if I can create a temporary sideboard that can work well under these conditions:

player 1 &amp; 2: Rakdos midrange / Gruul Vehicles / Rakdos sacrifice

player 3: GW Angels (rarely) / Izzet Phoenix (rarely) / Mono Green Devotion / WG Auras

player 5: UG poison (with Rotpriest and Ivy)

I am a big fan of NickelBrook brewery (Burlington, ON). I have enjoyed their Cause and Effect beer as well as the No Bad Daze beer. Brewed locally in Ontario. It’s happy hour right now. And No Bad Daze is on sale for $48 per 24. The HAPPYHOUR coupon gives you an additional 15% off. I just ordered 2x 24 = 48 tall boy cans for $81.60 delivered to my front door. Happy hour ends in 1 hour. Move quickly or miss out. Stock up for summer! Check to see if you qualify for free delivery (mostly GTA and southern Ontario addresses). Try their other beers if No Bad Daze is not to your liking. Cheers!

PS The coupon is HAPPYHOUR so make sure you add that at checkout!

&gt;the  B.C. Manual defines an “internship” as  on-the-job training to provide a  person with practical experience, often  offered for new graduates. The  Manual states that if an intern falls  within the definition of  “employee” and performs services for an  “employer”, the intern must  receive at least minimum wage. Although the  B.C. Manual is not binding  on a court, it does present the position of  the B.C. Employment  Standards Branch (which enforces the standards) and  it is persuasive in  court.Thus, given the broad definition of “employee” in the B.C. *Employment Standards Act*,   the narrow exception for practicum students, and the generally liberal   application of employment standards laws, most interns must be paid at   least minimum wage in B.C. unless they are a student engaged in an   internship required by the student’s education program. -[*https://gowlingwlg.com/*](https://gowlingwlg.com/)

From time to time they have happy hour gatherings or after work drinking at a bar or something. yesterday we had one of those. I was excited to go knowing I'm shy and I dont drink at all. I just wanted to be part of the team, and I think I am a funny guy amongst my friends (close friends) but it takes me a while to open up to others (even co-workers). I always worry of what others think of me, and that makes me nervous and uncomfortable in such settings. I feel like I don't have interesting things to offer as conversation... any ideas on how to overcome this?
TL; DR: how to not be shy in social settings?

But when you go to a mixology bar, do you feel like it's kind of a ripoff?? The prices are extremely high because they were made by mixologists and not bartenders, and the drinks are good, but I've never felt like I tasted something new. Most just taste like traditional cocktails with extra steps.

Really new to this (what a great time for me to want to throw in the ciggerettes 🙄🤦‍♀️)

I don't have much money, and trying to stock on  0mg flavours, to mix with my salts.

I noticed that on the mixology nz website they sell straight PG and VG, and also flavour concentrates.

Can I just purchase some of PG/VG, put some flavour concentrate in, and that's all I need to do to make my own juice?

I don't if I need to add anything else, or if the flavour concentrate is not really meant to provide a main flavour for big batches.

Can someone correct me, or let me know if/how they do it? Is it more cost effective?

Thank you guys so much!

# Intro to Mixology

One of the best ways you can enhance and experiment with shisha is by mixing flavors together. A good flavor mix is going to bring out the best aspects of each individual flavor, and provide a unique, personalized smoking session.

## Flavor basics

Oftentimes in the community flavors are broken down into several ‘categories’, common examples of these being ‘fruity’, ‘floral’, and ‘dessert’. You can find flavors that come in all kinds of tastes, some of which straddle the line or exist within two or more of these ‘categories’ at once.

When able, it’s best to smoke a new flavor by itself first in order to understand its aroma, taste notes, intensity, and preferred pack. With these three things in mind you can understand better what other flavors to pair and mix it with.

If you find a flavor is too ‘heavy’ or ‘warm’ when you’re smoking it, it might pair well with some mint in order to lift the flavor, whereas conversely if something is too ‘cool’ or ‘light’, you can pair it with some heavier flavors in order to balance it.

Not all mixology is based on balancing though, with creativity and perseverance you can find flavor mixes that produce almost entirely new smoking experiences. Breaking down a desired taste into what other flavors could make it up (think about how a dessert you eat can be broken down into chocolate, cream, and other sweet flavors) can help you in building a mix that tastes and smells like your desired outcome.

## Mixology techniques

## Sectioning

Sectioning is when you take different flavors of shisha and pack them normally in different parts of the bowl, not mixing or layering the different flavors at all. This is a common mixing technique you see in photos, as with different colors of shisha this presentation can be very pretty.

Sectioning is likely the easiest way to mix blonde and dark leaf shisha if you desire to, as well as any two brands that optimally pack at different densities. This technique is best used with HMDs, to mitigate ‘hot spots’ in your heat management that will only cook parts of the bowl and not fully mix your flavors.

## Layering

Layering is when you pack your shisha flavors in different layers, separating one flavor to the bottommost part of the bowl, then another flavor (or more) to higher parts of the bowl.

This technique will, when done properly, allow the flavors to gradually blend from one to another over the length of your session until they all come together. Different flavor layers are introduced at different times as the bowl and shisha heats up from top to bottom.

It can be difficult to use this technique to mix shishas which prefer different densities when packed, however when using the same brand or similarly dense shishas it can provide an enjoyable and interesting smoking experience.

## Full mixing

The most common way to mix two shishas is completely mixing them together before packing. This is difficult to do inside the bowl itself, so it’s best to mix them on a plate or cutting board before you begin packing.

Mixing like this ensures that the flavors are always warmed up together and will be present with each other in every pull. When mixing two brands of that typically use different densities, some will recommend you pack a full mix in an in-between density of the two, however in cases like this experimentation will always be required to find a sweet-spot that works for both shishas.",t2_w3hz3tkr,Hookah Wiki Revamp: Intro to Mixology,t3_1357mcg,1357mcg,HookahJoker,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/hookah/comments/1357mcg/hookah_wiki_revamp_intro_to_mixology/,0.88,6,mixology,0.2723056375980377,0.0260879471898078,0.1332574784755706,0.0307471305131912,0.0398012921214103,0.0512503236532211,0.3879186809062958,0.0214016884565353,0.0219910442829132,0.0152387879788875,0.9655801653862,0.03441978618502617

I recently stumbled upon a cool online feature called the Cocktail Hub, built on an app called Gluey. It's a collection of over 50 popular and enticing cocktails that's perfect for mixologists and cocktail enthusiasts alike. 🥂

The Cocktail Hub offers a user-friendly search experience, allowing you to quickly find the ideal recipe based on ingredients, origin, complexity, occasions, and more. It's a valuable resource for both experienced mixologists and those just starting their cocktail journey.

Unlike traditional bars, cocktail bars are focused on the art of mixology and crafting the perfect drink. Here are some key features that a great cocktail bar should have:

Creative and unique cocktail menu: A great cocktail bar should offer a wide selection of creative and unique cocktails that are not typically found at other bars. The menu should be thoughtfully curated and incorporate fresh, high-quality ingredients to create a unique and memorable drinking experience.

Skilled bartenders: The bartenders at a cocktail bar should be highly skilled and knowledgeable about the craft of mixology. They should be able to recommend cocktails based on individual tastes and preferences and be able to provide detailed information about the ingredients and history of each cocktail.

Premium spirits and ingredients: A great cocktail bar should use high-quality spirits and ingredients to create their cocktails. This includes **fresh fruits, herbs, and spices, as well as top-shelf liquors and unique liqueurs** that are not typically found at other bars.

Atmosphere: The atmosphere of a cocktail bar is just as important as the drinks themselves. A great cocktail bar should have a stylish and sophisticated ambiance, with comfortable seating, low lighting, and a relaxed vibe that encourages conversation and socializing.

Attention to detail: A great cocktail bar should pay attention to every detail, from the presentation of the drinks to the service and hospitality provided to guests. Attention to detail ensures that every aspect of the experience is enjoyable and memorable.

Also this is a great episode, one of the stand-outs for me, what're you guys' opinions on it? The only bit I slightly didn't like was that I felt like Annie didn't get much of a resolution to her mild identity crisis, just a few kind words from Troy made her grin and somehow fixed it while the stuff she was saying seems like bigger problems than that. I also thought it was weird how Shirley just left halfway through and didnt return although ig that was just cos they had to fit everyone left in one car for the end scenes. Also thought it was mean again that Pierce was kinda excluded from everything, everyone else drove together and actually spent time together lol.

I am currently working on my thesis (Wine &amp; Spirits MBA) and my subject topic is this one : *What is the Influence of Japan on the Cocktail Culture?*

I am open to any book suggestion, ideas, techniques, etc. 

So you know  what I have in mind for now : 

I will start by explaining how Japan has a way to turn anything into an art form, and how this impacts their dedication and willingness to be the best at what they do. I then want to go over the Japanese Tea Ceremony, and how it parallels with their way of making drinks and hosting clients. There will also be a part on the tools they use, and how they use them. For instance, they tend to prefer three-pieces shakers instead of a Boston shaker. They also developed their own variations of bar spoons, jiggers, etc. And finally, I  want to talk about Japanese alcohols, from sake to spirits, and how they use them, and why Western country start using them too. And throughout the entire thesis, I will keep in mind the idea of how much Japan is influencing the rest of the world, how people go to Japan to get trained there, or how Japanese bars are getting opened everywhere to introduce the world to their art.

\---

So the final week of the Mixology Class was yesterday, the one that we've been hosting at Good Time coffee shop on Anaheim and Coronado.

It was a success and so much fun! The owner and I are planning on having courses again starting next year after holidays!

I just wanted to share the news with everyone! I'll post again once we're planning on teach again!

Until then have a great holiday season guys!

2. How do y'all learn about new trends/techniques in the industry? I keep hearing about mocktails growing in popularity--what else is?
3. How do you learn about new brands/liquor releases on the market? I know in bigger cities sometimes brands will do tastings, but we don't have that luxury.

This segues into Troy saying that he's a snake and thus realizing that it's actually his 21st birthday, not his 20th.

It's a great throwaway joke - it pokes fun at the whole astrology culture, and it's funny that Troy remembers his Chinese calendar year and associated traits but he doesn't know how old he is - but it also does a fantastic job of foreshadowing Annie's arc in the episode. She proudly lists ""purposeful, self-possessed and gregarious"" as her own traits based on what she (presumably) read online, but is soon faced with the reality that she doesn't really know who she is. Completely small detail but must have been done with intention.

I am relatively new to mixology. I make cocktails at home but they're pretty basic. I like to experiment with different recipes, and I've tried dozens at this point. I really enjoy making simple cocktails, but want to get more into the science of it all. For example, what spirits pair well with what and when and in how much quantities etc.

I'm considering taking a bartending course to get some solid fundamentals like how to use the tools and how to pour and how to stock a bar. I'm worried, however, that a lot of bartending courses are geared towards literally becoming a bartender, and spend some time focusing on ""bartender"" skills like talking to customers, bar management, and stuff like that.

Is it a good idea to take the bartending course, or should I be looking for something else? What is that something else? Any advice on how to get started in the world of mixology would be greatly appreciated!

So I watched Mixology Certification right when I got home and after watching it Troys arc in this episode really spoke to me.  
All night Troy is looking up to Jeff because he thinks that is what a man is supposed to be like. Drinking scotch with two drops of spring water to activate the flavor, arguing over what bar is the best. 
Then right as he orders his first legal drink he notices everyone has been drinking. So he does the responsible thing and drives everyone home. He realizes that Jeff (the one he looked up to) was arguing about the same bar as Britta and figured out that they are just as dumb as him. Troy then talked Annie out of an existential crisis, told Abed not to be a tattle tale, and drove Jeffs car( which is all he really wanted to do that night). 

Troy is deemed a man not by the age he is, but by his choices that night. 
As I keep getting older I feel like a kid just trying to make it. And the defining differences between a man and a kid are the choices he makes.

I am very happy to announce that Good Time coffee shop is now accepting reservations for Mixology Classes starting the 19th of October! Signups are done through DM via their Instagram, [https://www.instagram.com/goodtime.lb/](https://www.instagram.com/goodtime.lb/)  

The flyer on the stories tab can be looked at here: [https://www.instagram.com/stories/goodtime.lb/2938176901232928771/](https://www.instagram.com/stories/goodtime.lb/2938176901232928771/)

I'd like to mention a few details that aren't mentioned/elaborated in the flyer.

The class is tailored for beginners/newcomers. We are focusing on basic technique, entertaining, beginner flavor theory, and what can be done with little equipment/ every-day equipment. It is designed as a fun, lighthearted experience meant to shed some light into mixed drinks and the bartending field. If you have an interest in mixing drinks and want a taste of what it's like, we are looking for you.

All participants must be 21 or older.

No alcohol will be mixed/provided during classes. We are using alcohol substitutes as a replacement for costs, safety, etc. 

This class is not designed as an entry point to the bartending profession, nor is it designed as reference to careers in the field. 

The class size limit is 7 people, 2 people have already signed. We have 5 SLOTS LEFT! THEY ARE FILLING UP FAST!

The class spans 5 weeks, with every week adding on to past information that was taught prior. Classes are taught every Wednesday **starting on the 19th of October, from 6:30 to 7:30.** **Commitment to the time slot is important**; if you feel you cannot oblige the full schedule please consider allowing another person to take the reservation. 

If these classes go well we are considering having more in the future to accommodate those who can't make the time slot, are looking for more advance classes, etc. Do not be discouraged if reservations fill up. We are shooting for the stars really, anything is possible. 

I am so, so incredibly excited to start this! I hope this event goes well and I'm really excited to be there! 

Cheers everyone! Feel free to DM the Good Time Instagram or myself if you have any questions!

Thank you to the user who tipped me about Good Time on Anaheim street; I visited there today before they closed and the barista there welcomed the idea with open eyes. He handed me a business card with the owners information and told me to reach him that way. 

I'm excited for the opportunity. Hopefully it all goes well and I can set up classes soon.

**Trigger warnings:** Mental health, suicide threats, cheating

**Disclaimer:** There was a lot of back and forth and stream-of-consciousness type answers, so I tried to summarize as best I could. Apologies for any spelling or grammar errors!

**Podcast summary:** Howie and his daughter Jacqueline are the hosts, she is a “bravo fanatic” and well up-to-date, Howie has “never watched the show” but met Tom through his producer who is married to manager/drummer of Toms band. They first met at the producer/drummer's wedding where Tom performed “Toto” by Africa. Jacqueline was very clearly Team Ariana, and Howie gassed Sandoval up the whole time basically saying everyone makes mistakes.

**Tom Interview answers:** (in no sensical order as they jumped around a bit)

\-Said he’s never been in a situation like this and doesn’t understand the attention because its not like “he’s the royal family or something” why is it on CNN. Thinks its because it happened during a slow news cycle

\-Says he felt an extreme flight-or-fight reaction in the aftermath and was “on the run” not showering or taking his medication, in the same clothes, etc., and is now starting to calm and be able to reflect on his actions.

\-Sandoval says he didn’t watch the WWHL with Schwartz but heard what he said and cannot be mad because there are a lot of accuracies in what he said.

\-Says Schwartz and Raquel only kissed at Scheana’s wedding because they had already been crucified like they were having a full blown relationship so he was proud of Schwartz for basically saying “F you” to them. Described Lala, Katie and Kristina Kelley as judgey and mean at the white party. He was a little bit jealous of the kiss but didn’t question his and Raquel’s connection

\-Says when he turned 40 he had a life moment and started looking at his life thinking “I don’t need this house, I don’t need this shit, but I need something to make me feel optimistic and motivated and alive again. He could tell he was feeling this way because Ariana was trying to plan trips together with him and all he could think was I don’t want to do this.

\-Says when this whole Raquel thing came along, he was in a very dark place in life, and it happened at the worst (but hopefully looking back best time) in his life, when he was in such a place yearning for a connection. Said his and Ariana’s relationship didn’t have connection and resentment started to build, his confidence was zapped, and he said due to lack of confidence “a sexual experience with him would be equivalent to a 19 year old his second time” because he had no mojo no game anymore. Says him and Raquel started becoming good friends especially after her and James broke up, talking all the time, facetiming, etc. There were three nights in a row they hung out just “talking until the sun came up,” – the first was guys night, then see you next Tuesday, and then the next night where they first kissed when they were talking outside of his house. He was locked out of the house and they were in the backyard near the firepit and they kissed and it was “magnetic and he felt alive for the first time in a long time.

\-After the kiss they tried to distance themselves from it happening again and he got himself into therapy to talk about it. He also tried to push Schwartz onto Raquel because “she’s f\*cking awesome.” Describes her as beautiful, smart, witty, funny, etc. Says this wasn’t to cockblock himself from her, but thought if Schwartz and her were dating they would all hang out more and it would be great because she’s so amazing.

\-Says he tried to break up with Ariana. Their relationship had become basically roommates and was lacking in intimacy. They would travel by themselves and not attend events together (e.g., he went to the producer/drummer wedding by himself). They didn’t share these issues on show because they didn’t want to give up the optics of being the power couple and the brand they had built together. She was out of it as well and didn't even notice he was being distant, even when he called her out and said ""you haven't noticed i've been distant.""

\-Says he started feeling this way a year prior and kind of drew a line. Says Ariana doesn’t like when you do something wrong and apologize but then do it again (duh?), but she would never apologize. Got to a certain point where she was just annoyed with him.

\-Said they were both going through a lot of anxiety and depression the year before but they handle it very differently, he handles it by staying busy, going out, hanging with friends, hobbies, etc, and she handles it by isolating and staying in bed all day.

\-His plan was to break up with Ariana in therapy because she would take it hard and he needed a mediator. Says it was never the plan to end it at the reunion. He said he would slowly hint at it in therapy and then started saying hypotheticals like “well what would you do if we broke up.” Said Ariana threatened to quit the show, not go to the reunion, forget about SAH, etc. He said after being clear in therapy he wanted to take steps to break up, Ariana started “fighting for it” and acting like a new person, listening to him and noticing him, etc., and “whoever gets that version of Ariana will be very lucky.” Says at this point he was already long gone though

\-Says after Raquel first kiss, he got into therapy immediately, because feelings were very strong, so he wanted to figure out what to do. Then those feelings started to take over and logic went out the window like nothing he had experienced before. Says Raquel and him weren’t physical but would facetime all the time and talk, Schwartz was right she was a drug to him, the relationship was healthy but the lie and the environment it created was unhealthy. Every time they were together the time felt fleeting and made them obsessed about seeing each other whenever they could. When it went down in Cancun, Schwartz didn’t know about it, He said there wasn’t a thrill to the secrecy, it just created anxiety and stress. Said he felt like Adam Sandler in uncut gems and couldn’t go anywhere because he was too recognizable.

\-Says he officially broke up with Ariana on Valentines Day, two weeks before she found the stuff on his phone and the scandal broke. Says she was in complete denial and threatened suicide (***see important edit below***) and disappearing and quitting the show. Says he was scared and didn’t know what to do.

\-Says a few times there are no excuses and what he did was f’ed up, but he is really down. Says worst part is friends he’s had for years and people he was closer to than Ariana are not even checking in on him and are using the information for content and not because they care about Ariana. Says he was the friend that showed up to events moreso than Ariana. Also says it hurts that they are all going back and saying all of the amazing things he did as a friend for them was because he was a narcissist and not a good friend.

\-Says Raquel and him are taking a break, they are not putting a label on it, and are just friends (not with benefits) right now.

\-Says him and Ariana are still in the house because they have been busy and they can’t afford to move, but use a go between to tell each other when they’re switching rooms or coming and going

\-Said she told him she was not letting him leave and he was going to have to force her out of the relationship

\-Says right before she found the stuff on his phone he went on a weekend trip to Miami with friends and they didn’t talk or check in the whole time because she knew they were broken up already. Said they agreed not to tell anyone because they had a big mixology event coming up and also didn’t want to destroy their brand and they should work out how to announce it to help each other out but she knew they were broken up. Then at the event the night she found the stuff on his phone, even though they “were never PDA in public” she grabbed him and kissed him in front of fans knowing he wouldn’t push her away, as she was in denial. Says he thinks she looked through his phone to see if anything happened in Miami.

\-Says he is not obligated to go back on VPR for next season, but ratings have shot up due to scandal so probably will. Says he’s been keeping distance from his bars to not create negative environment, and he’s a small part of big operation worried about his employees

\-Says he called up producers while filming and started putting their problems on camera because its not fair that everyone else went through stuff on the show but they didn't share any issues and Ariana has had to deal with barely any drama on the show

\-Says he is trying to turn over a new leaf in life, if anything good can come out of this is that he learns and never gets himself in this situation again, stay in therapy, etc.,

\-They shaved his mustache off to signify “new beginnings.”

**ETA:** (1) After Mexico Sandoval asked Schwartz about Raquel and Schwartz said he wasnt interested. Sandoval then told Schwartz about the affair (in August). (2) He is currently 4 days sober as he tries to work on himself

**ETA 2:** I wanted to add this comment from u/Lindsayyy589 because it is important. Sandoval does not use the word suicide. I took it as him implying this, but the comment is correct and it is up for interpretation. He said she said he would ""effectively be ending her life if he broke up with her.""

*level 1*[***Lindsayyy589***](https://www.reddit.com/user/Lindsayyy589/)*📷\*\*+3·*[*15 min. ago*](https://www.reddit.com/r/vanderpumprules/comments/12ivi6r/comment/jfvodu3/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)*The Golden Nugget? That’s like an all time low.*

*So I listened to the whole thing. I’m not sure we can confidently say Sandoval said Ariana threatened suicide after he broke up with her. He said something like- she said her life would pretty much be over if their relationship ended. I took it as her life would be over as she knows it, in the sense that she would quit the show, not be doing the sandwhich shop, have to move out of the house, etc. I do think that’s an important distinction. Not in defense of Sandavol but I just don’t think that’s what he meant.*

**ETA 3:** I went back and listened and I was wrong, this exact quote happens at 56 minutes (Trigger warning):

  “it was just like fully in denial, it scared me, it really scared me. you say why didn’t you just break up with her then? Its because of the threat of suicide, the threat of self-sabotaging, you know how much that hurts me..shes been on the show and gonna throw that away…”

#Post Body:

I noticed this on my recent viewing, that in a previous episode he mentions that JW’s can’t drink, but on his 21st bday he is prepared to drink before deciding not to. Is he only kind of a JW? They even make a big deal of not celebrating his bday earlier in the episode so that can’t be the case, right?

A quick googling says that JW’s can drink in moderation, but I swear on an earlier episode Troy says he can’t.

Now I’m just confused lol

edit - I added a comment to clarify why I was confused, since I made this post originally on my phone real fast. I should have put that comment in this edit but now I'm committed.

troy isn’t super into being a `jehovas witness` like he doesn’t celebrate his birthday (which i’m assuming is just because he’s used to not doing so doesn’t see a point) so he probably just wanted to try it out but you see how the episode played out

thanks for the responses! I sort of just thought of this real quick and posted it on my phone, but it did make me wonder a bit. It makes sense that plenty of people of various faiths would not necessarily follow every guideline exactly. It mostly just stuck with me because I swear there's an earlier conversation where someone mentions that` JW's` can't do fun things like drink, or something along those lines, but then him drinking (or ultimately not) becomes a major plot point later

`JW's` will drink if they wish, there is no dogma about drinking


Getting drunk they won't do, or shouldn't do

He’s not a very good `Jehovah’s Witness`.

I've always assumed Troy considers being a `Jehovah's witness` more like a part of his background/culture than a religion he practiced. I don't think the writers really thought much about it

Wrong. They can drink. Google their website.

EDIT: I now know this was a quote and I ruined the thread of subsequent quotes. Apologies.

You know what I don't like about` JW's` is the not celebrating holidays or birthdays thing. (Or the random letters from the local chapter trying to recruit us.) 

My husband's Nana is our last living grandparent and she gets left out of so many family gatherings because of her beliefs.  We have to make that extra effort to see her or call her on non holidays, which BTW she never does in return.  Holidays and birthdays are an extra automatic reason to see family and she misses out!  

Also! when you get together you can't really discuss anything because they feel all media (including literature) and sociatal influence is a distraction from the lord.  What's left?  Playing Scrabble (apparently this board game is okay) and talking about the weather or food.  

She's lived through the 20th century with some of the best music, movies, and art and didn't experience any of it.  No stories for the next generations.  Really?  You don't know about Elvis Presley or Costello??  David Hockney?  No.  Sister, you missed out.  

I know I sound bad admitting this, but it's the truth of having a random JW in your family.

It was a Thursday night and wasn't busy. The bartender was super hot. He was middle eastern, well dressed and groomed and he had a British accent. I pretty much neglected my girlfriends talking with him, asking him a million questions. He apparently moved from Essex to Atlanta after meeting a girl online and it didn't work out, but he loved the city and got his papers sorted to stay. He was 34, which I thought was really old at 22 😂😂. And it was so hot.

My girlfriends were pissed at me. They payed the bill but told the bartender that I was paying the tip and then eyeballed me contemptuously.

The bill was like $135 so I couldn't afford a decent tip. But I could tell that the bartender was really into me. He told me I was one of the prettiest Asian girls he'd seen come through. So I was like shit I have to give him something.
I walked around the bar and grabbed his wrist and demanded ""follow me"". I took him down the hall toward the bathrooms where it was very dark. He was laughing and said ""omg what is this?"" I took him to the bend that turns to the bathrooms and I said ""stand here"". It was so he could see anyone coming but no one could see me. The bathrooms were both single occupant with doors open and empty.

I asked ""is anyone coming?"" He said no. I took his hand with my right hand and lifted my dress with my left. I pulled his hand into my panties. I looked into his eyes and his eyes looked heavy with desire. ""Oh fuck"" he muttered. ""This is your tip. I said."" I put my hand over his and pushed two of his fingers into my pussy and furrowed my eyebrows and made the sweetest facial expression of pleasure I could and a little moan.

He immediately kissed me and turned and pushed me against the wall and pushed his fingers all the way in and lifted up as he slid them out. I yelped a little too loud from pleasure and grabbed his wrist and said ""yes but not here"".

He asked it I wanted to go to his place and I agreed. I texted the group and told them I was not coming out to the car. My bff replied ""have fun, he's cute"". I asked if he could drive me back to [my area] and as soon as he said yes I kissed him and pulled him against me. We made it for a couple minutes until a noise startled us.

Waiting for the bar to close wasn't so bad because he poured whatever I wanted for free and kept chatting with me.

I'll just say I had a very good night. But in the morning I asked him: If I had just let him finger me, would that have been a good enough tip? He said something like ""You literally fucked my brains out, but yes, absolutely, yes. That was one of the hottest things that ever happened to me.""",t2_w7eo24l3,[F28] I tipped a bartender by putting his hand in my panties and pushing his fingers in,t3_11w7to8,11w7to8,chellogirl993,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/SluttyConfessions/comments/11w7to8/f28_i_tipped_a_bartender_by_putting_his_hand_in/,0.96,279,bartender,0.0730559453368187,0.0256046522408723,0.2391303330659866,0.0351562388241291,0.0933093205094337,0.402187705039978,0.0234842225909233,0.0383388772606849,0.0384580008685588,0.0312746912240982,0.9587929248809814,0.04120708629488945

I haven't got the patience for it any more, and have been out of the game for some fifteen years.... 

But, whenever I'm out, I always take the empties back to the bar, and unless the service is terrible - I always tip. It's one of the few things I still carry cash for....

So a few weeks ago I was in a bar I have gone to for years, just not too often these days. A few staff and Management know me, and it's a place where they just wear clean casual gear to work, no set uniform. 

It's my round, and I lift three empty glasses and an empty bottle of our table, and take them up to the bar... The Manager, an old workmate of mine from years ago, who's helping the Bartender nods the knowing ""Another Round?"" nod, I nod back... And then put of nowhere I get the Karen tap on the shoulder...

""Excuse me, where is the Ladies room?""

(I can never help myself here. I've always been a cheeky bastard, and my first response is one of two options. ""Over there, just follow your nose"" or...) ""Sorry, no idea, I've never used the Ladies room...""

""Is that supposed to be funny? That's no way for staff to speak to a customer""

""Hey look, I was just joking.... I'm not staff, by the way... Its over there next to the-""

""What do you mean you're not staff? Why are you clearing tables then?""

""Uhhh.... I always bring the empties back... Once a Bartender, always a bartender""

""If you're a bartender you should be making drinks not making stupid jokes!""

""Look I'm sorry... Seems I've confused you. The toilets are just over there and I... don't ...work... here""

""What is your problem? Get me the manager NOW!""

Cue my Manager friend behind the bar, as he props the drinks on the bar -

""Hey CelticCynic, this round's on me. Now, Ma'am, you were asking for a manager?...""

I live in the city and manage paying rent. He lives with two housemates and a bit further from central (downtown). This is not a humble brag nor am I bashing him but he earns considerably less than I do. 

We’ve been together for a year and a half. We mostly meet at my place. I’ve been to his place many times. His housemates are lovely but with how often he is at my place I thought of asking him to move in. 

Financially it seems like it makes sense and would save him money driving over to see me each time.

I also really like him and I’m hopeful that he’ll say yes. He’s so fun, energetic and lively. If he were too move in I’m very flexible about how much he pays towards rent, 50, 30 or 20% because I’m managing okay paying 100% of it. Bills I’m also flexible about.

I have a general rule that I don't hit on or ask women out while they're at work because it seems unfair to reciprocate polite customer service with an uncomfortable proposition. And, I'm sure bartenders especially get a lot of customers who overstep. I've seen it. I do not want to be that guy.  
  
However, there's a local bar I go to somewhat infrequently and there's a very attractive bartender there that is, by all metrics of beauty, *way* out of my league. The first few times I went with friends and she just gave me this look, like she *hated* me. I remember asking my friends if I did something rude to her because I was convinced I offended her somehow. I probably went back twice more in the next two months and I had the same impression. She HATED me.  
  
Then, one day I went there for lunch with a friend and she took our order, looked me up and down, and said, ""sure thing, slut,"" or something to that effect. I smiled and laughed and asked her why she thought I was a slut, and she said, ""it just suits you,"" and walked off until she came back with our food, looked me in the eyes, and ate one of my fries.  
  
Next time I was there I ran into my stepsister and her friend and the bartender came over and asked if they wanted anything and my stepsister said she wanted to buy a drink for me on her tab, to which she said, ""why would you want to buy *him* a drink?"" I just smiled and my stepsister explained who she was and the bartender acted a little embarrassed, rubbed my bicep, and asked what I wanted.  
  
Each time I've been back since (again, not often), she's been, what I would consider, more flirtatious toward me than other patrons, but, like in a playful mean way. Last week, when I tabbed out she pretended to rub her breasts and vagina with my debit card and some of the other guys there saw it and gave me a wide-eyed look.  
  
I can come off as a pretty confident guy, even though I'm aware I'm not all that attractive, and a bit overweight. But, I have no earthly idea why this woman would be interested in me, and it's throwing me off because, to me, it seems like it's obviously not customer service when I pick up on things, some more subtle than others. I definitely make her laugh, and we have fun when she comes out to talk on breaks, but still...

2152,2023-05-08 13:04:00-05:00,1683569040.0,lostmedia,t5_38s0f,"Bartender is a drama featuring Lisa Spoonauer of Clerks fame, in Clerks she plays Dante’s girlfriend Caitlin and she plays a pretty major role in the films plot since she’s part of the love triangle Dante finds himself in. While she did come back for an episode of the cartoon adaptation of Clerks her only other acting role is Bartender which would appear to be lost media, only proof I can really find that the film ever existed is the cover art and the fact it’s listed on almost every big movie database site but always with zero reviews and little to no information. 

What we know: 

The cover art is available to find online and is on most movie databases 

Most major movie databases list this film but with little to no information about it and some have errors, like one listed the film was in Portuguese 

the IMDB page does have a synopsis of the film, it states that it’s about an aspiring acting working as a bartender who gets a chance to land the role of his dreams but to do so he must metaphorically sell his soul. 

From the cover I can see it was distributed by a company named Danehip Entertainment and was produced by a company named Java Films but both appear to be dead ends since Danehip brought up few results on google and Java Films I couldn’t find anything on because a European documentary distributor uses the same name and is all that pops up when searched.

I was able to find that Danehip Entertainment was releasing vhs tapes but couldn’t find anything about if they also released dvd’s so there’s a possibility that it was exclusive to vhs. 

The writer and star of the film Robert Zameroski would appear to be teaching at Valencia High School now, theres a chance if a student there hears about the search we could get more information about the film from him or hopefully track down a copy of the film assuming he owns one. 

This is all the information I could really find outside of a cast list that’s on the IMDB page so I’ve hit a brick wall in my personal investigation and I couldn’t really find anyone else at all looking into this, so I hope this brings attention to the film and that we can actually get some updates about it.

Update: 

The trailer for the film has been found on YouTube and thanks to finding this we now know the film was made in association with Bridge Pictures. It seems from the comments that multiple of his old students knew of the film so maybe there’s a chance one of them might have seen it or own a copy. [film trailer](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kMTqFY4CAjg&amp;feature=youtu.be)

Update 2: 

I guess this would now fall under the partially lost category since the first five minutes of the film have been found on YouTube, however it would appear to be dubbed over which might explain why one site I found said the film was in Portuguese. This gives me hope that maybe it was released in a few different countries and that there might be more about it online that I couldn’t find due to a language barrier. Also I learned the film was shown at festivals before getting distribution so there’s a chance someone might have been at one of these festivals and know more about it. [dubbed clip](https://youtu.be/4Ds6fjyTLNIAndthefirst5minutesbutitisn'tinEnglish)

Update 3: 

Both the director and writer have been messaged about the film and we are awaiting a reply, however I just noticed the YouTube channel that posted the five minute clip of the film has an email address in their bio and was active at least 9 months ago so there’s a chance they may be contactable, only issue is I don’t speak Portuguese, I am going to use google translate to try and email them however I do ask if anyone does know Portuguese or knows someone who speaks it please also try and email this channel since they would appear to be somewhat active and would also appear to have a copy of the film.

Update 4:

Gabe Torres the film’s director did get back with me, he says he doesn’t remember much about the films home video release but does know it had a short run in theaters in the US and also had a run in theaters overseas. He said he still owns a copy of the film, the masters of the film, and the 35 mm print. He also shared with me that Lisa gave a very emotionally dramatic performance and that she was a real actress, and that her performance in the film is better than her performance in Clerks. I do hope to hear more back from him but thought I’d update you guys with what he has shared with me thus far.

Update 5:

Sorry for the short window between updates wasn’t expecting him to get back with me so fast, he said for me to contact him again after may 17th since currently he is busy and that he will get back with me more about the film then. He also said when Lisa passed he made a tribute post on his instagram page gabecreates and that he used photos he took not long after the film was shot. Thank you guys so much for helping me, in one day we have learned so much and already are in contact with the director of the film. I don’t know if I can make the film see the light of day again but I do know I will share any and all information I learn about the film with you guys in the hopes it doesn’t stay forgotten. [Gabe’s tribute post](https://www.instagram.com/p/BUfFLIVhUfp/)

I feel like this should go without saying but will say it anyway because I have seen this happen before, but please no one message Gabe or Robert, they have already been contacted and the last thing we need is for them to get spammed with emails because that could get them upset with us. I know I probably don’t have to say this but since the search might go dark some until I can contact Gabe again next week I felt I should mention it just incase.",t2_sa3isoj,[fully lost] Bartender 1997 (Clerks Star Lisa Spoonauer’s last film),t3_13bzo0x,13bzo0x,Anarchy_Rulz,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostmedia/comments/13bzo0x/fully_lost_bartender_1997_clerks_star_lisa/,0.99,128,bartender,0.1090214625000953,0.152135819196701,0.2448831796646118,0.0667533427476883,0.0290970373898744,0.2345923632383346,0.0746786445379257,0.0188976526260375,0.0343655571341514,0.0355749800801277,0.9892526268959045,0.010747399181127548

I am on the 17th Jan, 6pm 7NEWS if anyone would like to watch the news report on it.

I have also filed a report to fairwork and I think it will be a pretty easy case for them. Someone pointed out that they did not follow the award pay increases which caught my attention as well as the fact that I was worked 9 hours without breaks which is also illegal. I will inform fairwork of these when they contact me again.

And whoever commented that the bar was spotless, you are spot on ;)
The owner claimed that she came from Sydney and cleaned for 4 hours after I left. Could be true if she was scrubbing the floors with a toothbrush.

It looks like currently the place is temporarily closed and the negative reviews have been removed.

To answer some other questions I see popping up:

I was making $60 an hour because of public holiday rates

I did not sign a contract or have seen any company policy at all. The only things I signed were tax file form, superannuation form and employee detail form.
Even if the contract had a clause in it regarding phone use and wage deduction, it would still not be legal. Check fairwork.gov.au regarding wage deductions

Overall, I have some previous employees contacting me as well stating that they had similar experiences so the owner might be in even more trouble with fairwork

Thanks everyone! Will keep you all updated.

So what had happened was a group of 6 girls came in and asked if they could get free drinks because they were all Irish, I of course told them no, but the whole interaction was good-natured and they were all laughing about it. They sat down at the end of the bar and ordered a few rounds of drinks over the next little while and were pleasant. 

Later in the night we got pretty slammed so one of the girls had to come up to me at the other end of the bar to put in another drink order, and when she did she asked if there was any chance of getting those free drinks now. I said it was still a no, but told her there was a mispour that she could have if she wanted it. (The other bartender messed up and made a drink the customer didn’t want, so it was up for grabs.) She said sure thanks and took it with her while I made the rest of the drinks she ordered.

When I brought the drink order over to the group, the other 5 girls were all suddenly very icy with me and didn’t really warm back up to me for the rest of the night. Since everything was fine up until that point and since the girl who got the mispour was still perfectly pleasant, obviously they were upset because I only gave her a “free drink” when they had all been wanting one. I feel like one girl was just in the right place at the right time but the other 5 probably feel like I was playing favorites.

I mostly forgot about it but then as I said, last night one of the girls came into the bar again and was giving me dirty looks which then got everyone talking about what happened, and now we’re all kind of debating whether I fucked up or not so I figured I’d ask here.

Consumers are confused and annoyed by service fees, their implementation and what shape the food scene will take in DC over the next few years. Restaurant owners also seem skeptical of the future, navigating inflation, new labor costs, and other hurdles that have cast a shadow on the capital's culinary institutions. 

A ton of the conversation has circled around rising wages that I-82 will bring. Supporters of I-82 say that this will help bring fair wages to tipped workers, and normalize an exploited labor market. It will also not place the burden on consumers to feel obligated to tip for people’s livelihood, but instead tip for good service. Opponents of I-82 state that this will place too large of an administrative and financial burden on restaurants, and staff of many restaurants also feel like this will end up making less money. 

As the debate has gone on, I feel like some crucial information has been missing from the conversation. The claims that restaurants would not be able to take on the financial burden, mixed with the staff claims that they will make less money seemed like guess work. I would read articles, talk to people in the industry, and often walk away thinking the same thing, I want to see your books. To me, this is an accounting and math problem that no one wants to solve. 

Luckily, I was in a position to try and examine some numbers, even if they were out of date. I have worked in the DC restaurant industry on and off from 2015 to 2020. I decided to go back and look at my old bank and tax statements to try and place some numbers on this conversation. 

I will start in 2017. While I worked in college as a bouncer and barback, it was intermittent and hard to create a clear picture of payment. I graduated college in May of 2017, and started working as a server soon after. This breakdown will show what the restaurant paid me. It will not include cash tips I made (minority of what I made, vast majority of people pay by card).

|October|$1,097.64|
|November|$954.02|
|December|$999.24|
|Total|$8,051.58|

&amp;#x200B;

I will add some context, because people are probably curious how I survived. From June to August, I lived in a twin bed under the stairs in a friend's house. I was Harry Potter. It was a nice group house that had about 8 bedrooms plus one under the stairs. I paid about $500 for the summer. After that I moved into a townhome with friends, and paid $750 a month in rent. Also, the restaurant was pretty chill about the staff eating and drinking their food, so my bills were very low. Finally, being 23, I was still on my parents phone and health plans. 

Now for 2018. Starting in January of 2018, I gained an internship on the Hill. It had a stipend of $500 a month. My main source of income was still tips via customers. Working two jobs was no fun. The breakdown will not include my Hill stipend.

|September|$707.15|
|October|$812.94|
|November|$850.44|
|December|$292.9|
|Total|$13,739.43|

This year was more stable than the previous one. I was making enough to get by, and starting in August I gained a salaried position once my internship ended. I also moved to a different restaurant group. Over this year I had moved on from server to bartender. As I transitioned into a full time salaried job, I took less hours in the restaurant field, and you can see the drop off occur between August and September. 

In 2019, I worked much more sporadically, because it did not need to be my main source of income, just had to supplement my salary. I accessed my 2019 tax return to see the total made in 2019, instead of having to go through each month individually. In 2019, I made $5,876.72 working in restaurants. 

**Conclusion:**

For a variety of reasons, I was able to make this lifestyle work. I lived in cheap group housing with friends, had family support, and often had more than one source of cash coming in. But it was definitely difficult. But I think it can help tell a story. 

First, all the restaurants that I worked at are still running in DC. The first place I worked at in 2017, that ownership group has opened other restaurants in the DMV area. I moved on from them to a restaurant group that has many locations in DC. Both places I worked at for them are also still open. Even with all the struggles the industry is facing, they obviously have made money. 

I wish that I had a better breakdown of hours worked, but I gained a general idea as I went along. I will note (specifically in 2017) I remember a few times when tips did not cover what would have been DC minimum wage for the hours I worked and the restaurant had to match what I would have been owed. I don’t think it ever occurred once I transitioned to bartending. As I was exploring my old statements, the transition between employers helped paint a clearer picture of hourly wages. The first place paid me via direct deposit in a lump sum of tips and hourly wages. The second I would go in and pick up physical checks. One check represented tips, the second was my wage. This left a very funny trail in my bank, as there would be back to back deposits that would look like $121 for one and $17.25 for the other. And this visualization of the back to back deposits of tips vs wage is what I want people to understand.  

From how I see it, the money is being spent. People were coming and patronizing these restaurants, and spending enough money to support the restaurant, and my livelihood. As I-82 takes effect, restaurants need to step up and work with staff. For consumers, the lump sum being spent at these institutions shouldn’t change much, but instead of it being luck and charity determining staff's weekly pay, a normalized hourly wage will take its place. 

Final takeaways:

* Restaurant staff, do not assume that I-82 means you will make minimum wage. Look at what you are making now. That should be your hourly rate! People are already spending that money! If the restaurant institutes a service fee and pays you significantly less, you are being ripped off. 
* Restaurants need to work with their staff to find a balance. This industry is very boom and bust. Some weekends are trash, others will pay your whole rent. But over time a median will form that should show both parties what a fair wage would be. 
* Not all places are struggling, and new restaurants continue to open. I think places will figure out this balance, but it should happen sooner rather than later. Consumers and staff will be hurt during the transition, especially if restaurants fight the change instead of adapting. 
* Adjustment will have to happen. But the money is being spent. Managers and owners should compile the total amount of tips made during a month from all staff. This would give a good idea of what people are already spending at their restaurant. That knowledge could help them plan how best to pay staff, and what menu adjustments are necessary. 
* A lot of restaurant work is not great pay, as you can see from my breakdown. While I know a lot of people make good money, a lot of others basically make minimum wage. The current system allows for uncertainty and exploitation, as tips are not reliable, and often can be stolen. 

I hope this breakdown can give people a visualization of what staff could be making at restaurants, and a better understanding of how owners should work to figure out how to take the total sum consumers are spending (bill+tip) and translate it into living and fair wages for their staff.",t2_84d9v3f4,A Tipped Wage Breakdown: Yearly Earnings of a Former Server/Bartender,t3_1327kt9,1327kt9,FaithInGovernance,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/1327kt9/a_tipped_wage_breakdown_yearly_earnings_of_a/,0.72,37,bartender,0.204521894454956,0.1214446127414703,0.09381615370512,0.1596751362085342,0.0989475846290588,0.1146150380373001,0.0420591197907924,0.0555547513067722,0.0631171986460685,0.0462485626339912,0.9757615327835083,0.02423849143087864

There's been a lot of talk over the past few weeks about Saramago and job loss, and many would like to place the blame at the feet of unions and unionised workers. Do not fall for this victim blaming rhetoric. Businesses like Saramago, Abandon Ship and so on close down only through faults of their own that begin with poor staff treatment and ends with refusing to meaningfully engage with representatives of the workers. 

Anyway, to the point of the post:

For anyone looking for a job in the hospitality industry, please join *Glasgow Bartenders Club - Recruitment* page on Facebook. Contrary to the name, this page advertises a wealth of roles beyond bartending: from waitering, management, cheffing and barista work - among others. 

Not everyone knows this page exists, so it's easy to be led to believe that it is tough finding a job in the hospitality sector. The opposite is true. There are many roles available as businesses are crying out for staff, **so know your worth, join a union and pursue a healthy workspace and decent pay**. Saramago couldn't offer those things when open, and they certainly cannot do so now. Victory for unionised workers and hopefully a decent employer will occupy that space soon. 

Depending on volume demand, I'd be happy to glance at people's CVs if they are having trouble hearing back from hospitality employers - I've worked in the industry in quite a few roles for some time. Just DM me and I'll have a read when I get a chance.

Edit: On Facebook there is also: 

*Glasgow Disco Shifts* - for anyone looking to be paid daily/weekly for work while they job hunt, or even just to get more hours. It's less active but worth joining.

*Glasgow Chefs* - for chef jobs in Glasgow.

I just got off a ship where my family had 2 connecting rooms. Since it was officially booked with one adult in each room, I got a deluxe drink package and my husband, who doesn’t really drink, didn’t have to. So we only had one beverage package total. The most “sharing” that I did was letting my husband take a sip of my piña colada to see if he liked it before he went up to the bar and ordered one on his own sea pass.

That said, MANY times I would take one of my kids to a bar and order myself a drink and them a virgin daiquiri or a soda. My kid was right there with me and I would ask them in front of the bartender what they would like, so there was no confusion on the situation. The bartender would always ask for their card and I would tell them they don’t have a package and to charge me. They only did this once or twice though. They would run my sea pass and I would sign a receipt. The rest of time they just gave it to me. Even at the promenade coffee shop- I ordered myself a latte and my daughter, who was in line with me, a Frappuccino. The barista asked for her card, and I said to charge it on mine. So then he asked for my stateroom number so he could put it on my husband’s card, and I told him my husband doesn’t have a drink package. So then the barista wrote down my stateroom number and said he would just charge my card for her frap in 5 minutes. The same exact scenario happened in Vitality when I got my daughter a smoothie and me a cappuccino. This was sort of the routine. They would ask for my stateroom number so they could charge my kid’s drink to the other adult’s package, almost everywhere.  And it wasn’t a convenience thing- the times I was charged for the kids’ drinks they scanned my sea pass and printed off a receipt to sign like there was no package. 

I assumed they just wanted to be nice to the kids and I accepted the drinks, but kind of lived in fear that my package would be revoked, because I always read here and on Facebook about the strict no sharing rule! And then I was thinking about this being one of the reasons the packages are priced so high. But maybe this is normal? Does anyone else have experience with them giving your kids free drinks when you are getting alcohol? Were they just trying to rack up extra tips?",t2_csiz0lr,Bartenders giving free drinks to my kids all week.,t3_12sy2w3,12sy2w3,aNursierNurse,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/royalcaribbean/comments/12sy2w3/bartenders_giving_free_drinks_to_my_kids_all_week/,0.79,62,bartender,0.5202724933624268,0.0667745620012283,0.0897757038474083,0.0527814216911792,0.0678713247179985,0.1334002614021301,0.0209629666060209,0.0174758844077587,0.0192035045474767,0.0114818587899208,0.9938832521438599,0.006116704549640417

2280,2023-04-14 22:33:34-05:00,1681529614.0,bartenders,t5_2smw0,"I was hired as a bartender for a brand new high-priced Mexican bar and restaurant here in Glendale, AZ. My barber had a friend who was a DJ who knew the GM that'd be opening up this place. I had worked there probably only 2 days. First day, the bar shift lead taught us the specialty cocktails once and then me and the other new bartender girl got cut since the place was pretty dead. Second day, I worked a little but nothing too crazy. I remember their was one specialty drink in particular, this bar shift lead asked to be remade because I used the ginger ale mix when that's what the recipe called for and the gun's ginger ale wasn't working.

Come back for my third day the following week, and I find out that the GM who hired me is no longer going to be there and that the bar shift lead is now one of the managers. I remember I got a ticket for 2 margaritas, made them fine. Then for some reason I got another and the bar shift lead came over and was watching me and said that I over poured? &amp; Made me dump that Tequila out of the jigger. Then for some reason, they were coming out short when I poured them out of the mixer. Basically I missed an ingredient from how they want their Margs to be made specifically and he made me dump them out. Made them again and for some reason they were still short. He made me dump them again and called me out for wasting product. Finally I realized I hadn't poured enough agave and they were fine. So basically, I wasted 3 margaritas almost when to be fair they could've been topped with s&amp;s and have been fine. Their were recipe cards that were there for us but I owned that I made a mistake.

Then get another ticket for another one of the specialty cocktails, pump it out and then he says it has to be remade. Then saw me make another drink and said that it had to be made in the glass and not the shaker and he had already told me about that drink in specific. It was a lot cause theirs at least 10 different specialty drinks and I just didn't process it right then and there.

Ended up closing the bar and mopped the entire floor and then he comes back and says ""Can we make sure that we mop, please"" &amp; I said ""I just mopped already"" &amp; Then he asked me to do it again. Yup.

Basically I end up getting a text the next day, that they're ""ending this employment relationship"" Been feeling like trash about it cause I had gotten fired from a casino job a couple of months ago but for other reasons. I understand I fucked up on those drinks earlier but felt like it could've been addressed differently.

Vodka I could handle about 3 shots and then I would start vomitting. Margaritas and stuff too, pass. 

So I went to a bar with some friends this weekend and decided to choose a brand just based off the sticker on the bottles lol. Turns out I liked it - I did vomit later bc of weed - but I found the taste bearable and I was drunk after 2 glasses

https://www.totalwine.com/spirits/bourbon/small-batch-bourbon/blue-note-juke-joint-straight-bourbon-whiskey/p/234186750


Anyways, I got lucky that time at the bar. If I go to a bar, in let’s say, New York, and I go upto the bartender and say “Blue Note whiskey” will I get the same alcohol? My friends told me this is a whiskey. So if “Blue Note whiskey” is not available, should i say “Let me get a whiskey please” Is there a specific type of whiskey? Bourbon whiskey? 

Also the bartender at this bar asked me something after and I just said regular. I think she added ice? Not sure

Jack Daniels sounds like a similiar brand, too right?

**Summary** *(Length—17:48)*

*Gender notes:* Listener is referred to as having a ""cock"" and a ""dick"". Listener is also once referred to as having a 'happy-trail'.

You say you're in town for a ""business trip"", but this stranger of a bartender knows better. I know why you're really here—so, let's get to business, shall we . . . ?

I had a lot of fun making this one—even if it did take me six months to get around to completing. . . . Still though, I hope you all enjoy it. Don't hesitate to let me know of anything you'd like to hear from me. I do enjoy making audio content, even if my schedule doesn't allow a lot of time for it.

I just realized too that I'm incredibly close to three-hundred followers. That is incredibly shocking to me, given how relatively small my output has been. Hopefully I'll be able to make more content this summer as I will then be out of college. Thank you all for enjoying what I've produced so far! &lt;3

Most if not all the events I bartend for are all open bars, like corporate events and weddings, anything from 8 to 800 people. We do get a percentage of the gratuity depending on how many hours we worked that week. We are allowed to accept cash tips, But they will NOT allow us to have visible tip jars, since they believe it’s a bad look.
 Most days, no matter how much I bring my A-game, and even go out of my way to refill people’s drinks at their tables so that they don’t have to get up, I almost always go home with absolutely NOTHING. If I’m lucky I’ll get $13 or something like that.             
My question is, how should I feel about 
this? I am very grateful for the gratuity but I do feel like I can be making more if I could have a tip jar. Honestly, if I knew I was going to an open bar, I would always bring cash to tip the bartender. Why wouldn’t you?

We had driven about 3 hours to get there, and after having salty fried food on the drive I was extremely thirsty. This was towards the beginning of my shift away from alcohol. Dipping my toe into 100% sobriety but very uncomfortable and insecure doing so.
We walked into the venue and the bartender asks us all for our drink orders. I go last and ask for an iced water.
""Water? No you need a drink!"" 
""No thanks, just a water for me"" 
""Let's try this again, what are you drinking?"" 
""I just want a water"" 
""you'll have a beer"" 
And she pours me some gross frat boy light beer. 

Everyone I was with was shocked but I was so embarrassed I didn't want to make a scene. I quickly took the beer, walked farther down the bar, left it, and asked a different bartender for water. I think if I were not attempting sobriety I would have been angry and simply not receiving the item I asked for. Something about trying to not drink made me very insecure. 

If this were to happen to me now I'd have the confidence to tell her to go fuck herself. How disgusting to force a drink on someone. And she didn't even know if I had Celiac Disease and couldn't have gluten. Just awful. 

My fiancée and friends said they supported my choice and nobody in my social circles pushes me to drink which I appreciate and it goes a long way in reaching my goals. It makes life easier to have good people around you.

I’m looking for something for the college kids who don’t wanna spend 10-12 bucks on their first smoke. I wanna but a $2 stick and sell it for $4/5 and hopefully help some kids get into cigars.

The boss already sells cigars here, but they are the cheapest ones you can get, kept in a jar with no seal or humidity packs. Students and newbies buy them but anyone who knows anything cringes at the sight of them.

I really enjoyed serving and I’m interested in maybe bartending if I can get on the job training, but I’m worried if I’ll be able to make enough money to support myself?

It's based on my experience of living in this region for 4 years. Of course it's not comprehensive, but that means anyone who wants to contribute in the future can. My list is primarily based on beers in the Spanish Basque Country, from Bizkaia, Alava, and Gipuzkoa. 

**Breweries:**

Of course I can't know them all, but I know many. 

Basqueland - is the king of basque craft beer. They release new beers often (possibly too often), and is the standard of basque craft. They experiment a lot. 

Gross - Very popular brewery with a great taproom in Donosti-San Sebastian. They don't experiment too much.

Laugur - They are known for their very strong Russian Imperial Stouts. They are loved by the hop heads in Basque Country. 

Mala Gissona - They have solid beers, but mostly stick to the same roster of reliable ales.

Drunken Bros - Small brewery with not much experimentation. 

Bizio - This is cider of the highest level. It's organic, and bio friendly. The sediment at the bottom of every bottle is delicious. 

Saltus - For me (a west coast transplant), the best West Coast IPAs in the region. Great craftsmanship.

Meta Edabeak - very adventurous crafter who focuses on local ingredients and flavors. 

Mitika - from Navarra, but still Basque Country - great line of beer inspired by basque myths. 

Naparbier - from Navarra, with a great selection of IPAs and stouts

**Bars** (again, I don't know every spot, but I know many. If I have something to say, I write. If not, I don't:

DOGEIPA offers a safe place to take refuge amidst the volatility of the crypto market. This is made possible by their tokenized craft beer, which is linked to the Dipa coin and allows the user to profit when the price goes up while also earning from the sale of each craft beer sold.

DOGEIPA gives investors the unique opportunity to use their funds to purchase physical products with real value such as their own tokenized craft beer. The process is simple: first, buy Dipa tokens; then simply enjoy as thanks to the sale of the tokenized craft beer a portion is allocated to buy the token and perform monthly burns, making its value increase as the tokens in circulation are reduced; finally taste the different varieties of craft beer provided by the brand and enjoy as you watch the real value grow within the blockchain world.

In addition, DOGEIPA has developed innovative tools that allow the user to receive BUSD for holding the investment, monthly lotteries and participate in private pre-sales of craft beer varieties with juicy bonuses. With DOGEIPA you can see how profitable your operations are without the need to be trading for medium term profits thanks to the limited supply currently available which is reduced month by month, adding up all the BUSD received for transactions made on the token will ensure you considerable profits in the long term.

So, if you are looking for a safe way to protect yourself against unpredictable crypto market downturns without sacrificing quality or fun then there is no better choice than DOGEIPA!",t2_3kq70fxz,"First product tokenized of the world, craftbeer",t3_10la39g,10la39g,LegitimateTowel3786,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TokenFinders/comments/10la39g/first_product_tokenized_of_the_world_craftbeer/,0.5,0,craftbeer,0.7484478950500488,0.0625477284193039,0.1096529439091682,0.0164795573800802,0.0099665001034736,0.0179151985794305,0.0072976634837687,0.0069557316601276,0.0104574263095855,0.01027940120548,0.9935457110404968,0.006454274989664555

I  enjoy this community more than anything. I just love the passion of all  fellow redditors in their projects and today I am proud to share with  you [Wine Routes 2.0](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.phonegap.wineroutes).

Wine  Routes app is available to all wine lovers who wish to visit vineyards  and wineries, discover wines, design their own wine routes and join a  large community dedicated to wine.

Main idea of the app

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each  user has access to thousands of wineries and may get information about  them (contact details, location, products, events, images etc), share  their opinion through a review or a simple Like, plan and save a route  of preferred wineries, follow a recommended route, view events organized  by wineries or browse their uploaded images.

Goal of the app

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wine  tourism concerns all activities related to touristic journeys in wine  regions with objectives to discover a wine region and its terroirs,  taste different wines and meet wine-growers. The long-term goal of the  app is (a) to promote wine tourism not only for the popular wineries but  for all of them, giving the opportunity to new winemakers to show their  products and (b) strengthen the winelovers' community by establishing a  common means of sharing wine opinions, Wine Routes

Why must winelovers get this app?

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------

All winelovers are able to:

\-  view thousands of wineries with contact information, availability for  visitors, social media pages, products' descriptions and events  organized

\- consult a large collection of routes suggested by winemakers and users themselves

\- plan their own routes and save them for future trips or use GPS to plan a route from their location and follow their route

\- share their experience about a winery with other winelovers

Ive had 3 ideas for PW fanfics but ive not been able to choose which to write first.  
Explaining what each fanfic would entail:  
Stargazers - Follows the story of astronauts in Low Earth Orbit, the Moon, and a space center in Sawaiiki through their troubles with stuff like the Second Calamity  
Nomad - Follows a group of *""Nomads""* as they are called (People who tresspass and or live in Exclusion zones) and their hardships via. logs by the main character.  
Winelovers of Salvemini - Follows CIF soldiers Adrian and Risso (minor characters in Mission 4) through the events of the Cascadian Conflict and where they eventually end up after the war.

I am a huge fan of fantasy medieval worlds stories and as such George RR Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire has a very close spot near to my heart. I have been craving some good asoiaf and game of thrones content for some days and have decided to come forth and do a roleplay about it.

So this roleplay is going to happen with only canon characters but if you have any OCs you want to use you can do that too. I have a specific pairing that I am interested in using for this roleplay because it involves two of my favorite characters and I read a story with them and was completely entranced by it until the author stopped updating. I am huge fan of Robert and Rhaegar most importantly their angry relationship. However I can't help but imagine what might have happened if they had a good relationship as cousins normally had or better yet what if one of them was born a girl. Obviously they would be wedded to each other and that's what I want to explore here.

I will be writing the female character in this roleplay, either Female Rhaegar or female Robert and I want a male partner to do the other end of the pairing. It's simply want to swap the gender of one of them (not an OC) and make them female. They already have some history in canon and dynamics with each other that would work very well. It can be either female Robert × male Rhaegar or male Robert × female Rhaegar. It's entirely your choice on which you want to do.

I can play both male and female characters and I will choose accordingly depending on who you want to play and how you want to play them as. 18+ scenes are inevitable in a roleplay like this so please be 18+. I have plots ready for both versions, with a seperate plot for female Robert au and another one for female Rhaegar au.

The idea for genderbent Robert is that the Mad King orders a marriage between his heir and Roberta Baratheon the daughter of his cousin and trusted friend. However she is in love with Ned and not enthusiastic about wedding the crown prince or becoming the future queen. How does she deal with all that? 

The plot for genderbent Rhaegar is pretty straightforward. Viserys will be older in this au and will be Rhaenyra's husband until he messes everything up with the Starks and Baratheons starting the war. After Robert's victory and Lyanna's death Jon Arryn urges Robert to marry Rhaenyra to unite their claims and Robert begrudgingly does. This will fall heavily into the enemies to lovers genre. 

You choose which one you want to do. Anyway that's my rant. If you have any doubts regarding anything my dms and chat are always open. Thanks for coming down this far. I am a very active roleplayer and can do multiple posts per day even if it isn't rapid fire replies. However I don't expect you to match my amount of replies but at least one reply per day would really warm my heart &lt;3

That's not all and we don't have to add all of it in the roleplay as well.

I'm with you again! Today Italy and the Tuscany region. Villa Pillo is quite an adult winery with bold ideas! 🍇

Villa Pillo is a traditional Tuscan agriculture. It was founded already in the Middle Ages, this is what the records in the books stored in the archive of the economy tell about. It is located near the historic town of San Gimignano, which is located in the heart of the Tuscan viticultural area – Chianti. The estate is spread out on the charming hills around Gambassi Terme and includes about 500 hectares. In addition to vineyards, which occupy about half of the total area, the farm owns about 50 hectares of olive groves and the same amount of area is given for sowing. The Supertoscan blend of the Borgoforte farm was included by Wine Spectator in the top 100 wines of the year 2016.

Today we are talking about the blend that is in this bottle - Cabernet Franc and Merlot. The Tuscan variation on the French blend was a success. Less acidic and smoother than at home. Fruity, with tones of blackberries, prunes, ripe cherries, black currants and hints of vanilla, the aroma in combination with rich, velvety, with tones of dark berries, black currants, prunes and spices will not leave indifferent even the skeptical! The completion in the form of a fruity-spicy aftertaste with nuances of vanilla will also appeal...

Perfectly combined with meat paste, red meat, medium-aged cheeses, dried delicacies. 🤔 🍴Alas, its storage potential is not great: only 1-2 years.

Was recently treated to a very nice weekend by my wife's aunt in Healdsburg and want to send her a nice bottle as a thank you.  Price isn't a factor within reason (under $150 I think is a good benchmark), she prefers red and as far as type I think she likes them all (was drinking Zinfandel all weekend).

She knows her wine very well, so extra points if you know of a good source for a hard to find bottle.  Thanks for the help!

2642,2022-11-16 19:18:30-06:00,1668647910.0,FansHansenvsPredator,t5_3gwdg,"I’ve seen many people asking for others to give a quick run down on Lorne’s time after leaving prison for trying to fuck a small girl and now. I’ve watched SortaKindaBored’s layout a couple times and I’m gonna try and say it in as least words as I can…

Ember Infierno, aka Emmuh, aka lots of other characters makes first contact with a letter with her phone number, Oreos, and other niceties. 

Ramona Quimby’s (first major catfish gf)mother is watching TCAP and shows Ramona because Ramona loves true crime shit. Ramona is intrigued with Lorne and has her brother contact Emmuh for Lorne’s contact info. 

Lorne is with Ramona for roughly a year. With Ramona’s saga we see the doctor, the therapist, Ramona’s bro, and Machelle Simpson who was a catfish trying to meet Lorne at Dunkin Donuts for sex. This character was to test the waters to see what they could get away with. 

Catfish after Ramona is Casey Mauro played by Tiffany Lockhart and Emmuh (yea the Casey Mauro from the sting). She’s about 30, addicted to drugs and sex, has a couple kids, lives with her evil rich father, and has had a horrible life in regard to sexual assault. Casey has a brother named ~~Will~~  Nick. Casey’s dad Paul “bought” Casey and ~~Will~~  Nick as children so he could make them actors and become rich.  In the end this wasn’t Casey Mauro at all and was actually Winifred Pollard aka Emmuh.  

*Will is Winifred Pollard’s ex husband and the person Jamie Amy had dated and still has strong feelings for — Lorne has a love hate relationship with dude*

Winifred Pollard aka Wendy aka Winnie is the third catfish and is played by Ember Infierno. Lorne refers to her as Winnie because his buddy Tony has a wife named Wendy and Lorne is simpleminded and will get them mixed up I guess.lol She is addicted to coke and has schizophrenia that came about when she was 22. She’s also a white supremacist and holds Hitler in high regard.  Winnie is talked to the most and she makes Lorne miserable, but he stays because he’s desperate. The Winnie saga is about a year long. Characters introduced here are Dan aka Crestfallen who is a lawyer and Emmuh’s bf. Lorne stays jealous of him and Winnie is inappropriate with him. There is also Debbie aka Tiffany Lockhart. There is Rhoda aka Emmuh and she is Winnie’s 17-18 year old daughter. There is GG aka Emmuh with a voice changer. This is Rhoda’s ex bf and father of LJ, Rhoda’s baby. There is also Victor, aka Emmuh with a voice changer. He’s got HIV and is a paraplegic. Then there is Jamie Amy aka Winelover. She’s Winnie and Debbie’s friend and is also a 23 year old porn star. 

Some main things that happen with Winnie is Lorne grooming Rhoda, his gf’s barely legal simpleminded daughter. One time Winnie gets a batch of bad cocaine and it puts her in the hospital. She, for some reason, gets ahold of a Die With Dignity pill and puts it in a brownie because she wants to die with dignity instead of rotting away with a sickness. While Winnie is in the bathroom one day Rhoda asks Lorne if she can have a bite of her moms pot brownie and he says yes. Winnie has put the death with dignity pill inside the brownie and Rhoda dies. The funeral was over the phone and it was hilarious. This situation also birthed one of my favorite quotes from anything…

“ITS SUPPOSED TO BE DEATH WITH DIGNITY, NOT MURDER BY PEDOHILE!!!” 😂

Lorne moves on to Debbie, Winnie’s sister. Debbie gets Lorne to open up and talk to her and also gets him to read the chatlog from the sting with her and Emmuh outloud. She legitimately tries to help him for real, but Lorne is turned down by Debbie and and we learn that Lorne didn’t ever want to get better or anything, he just thought he could score with Debbie if he played the game. It’s infuriating really. Lorne never dates Debbie, but Lorne still gets jealous and rages. We hear of Angelo aka Emmuh with a voice changer and on Mother’s Day he says “bye pedo” to Lorne and Lorne rages all day and spends 10 minutes with his mom for mothers day because he was so upset at Debbie. He airs his grievances loudly and angrily to Dan and Jamie Amy. 

Between Winnie and Jamie Amy sagas, Lorne goes to jail for parole violations. He stays for six months. 

Lorne dates Jamie Amy the pornstar who has had a rough time with men and is an alcoholic pornstar/cam girl and you know with Lorne’s jealousy how well this went. In this saga there is Will aka Heelborne aka Winnie’s ex-husband (I’m so sorry if I’m wrong.. I do admit I’m not as familiar with Jamie Amy as the others) and MJ aka Maggie Joe and I’m not sure who she is voiced by. Both of these people are Jamie’s exes. There is also Chef Jeff, Rod, and Todd. Jamie gets Covid and it gets so bad she has to talk to Lorne with a British male robot because he couldn’t understand the female voice. There are for sure other folks, but I cannot recall them right now. 

Jamie, Casey Mauro (ageen), and Lorne also start a thrupple that lasts for a short minute. 

The thrupple eventually falls apart and Casey tells Lorne that she was being blackmailed to catfish Lorne. 

Now here we are at the Cas3y calls. 

Dipshit has learned nothing and second guesses everyone who comes into his life, but he can’t help himself. No matter how rude and hateful these people act he keeps running back to them simply because they’re the only friends he has. His main irl friend Tony has died.

I'm looking to replace my Orrefors Difference glasses and have kind of decided on the Spiegelau Definition series. But which ones?

I really enjoy chardonnays from Bourgogne and Jura, think Domaine Labet, as well as Pinot noirs from the same regions. But I mix it up with a lot of different stuff. Basically salinity, minerality and acidity is my kind of wine. But I also like to throw in natural wines of all kinds, some more wild than others. Sometimes there will be champagne, but almost never vintages.

So which glasses? White wine and Bdx, Burgundy and Universal?

Alto Douro (‘the high Douro’) is the world’s oldest wine-growing region. Along Portugal’s Douro River, wine has been grown for centuries. Even the Romans realized the area’s ideal dry-hot climate condition and planted vines in the region. Alto Douro is the first ever protected wine-growing region with its borders officially defined in 1756, and it became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2001. The region is home to the famous Port wine, and it’s also well known for its dry reds. But it’s the focus on history and tradition that makes Douro so magical. In fact, when visiting, you might see grapes being picked by hand since the hills are too steep for machines, or you may even be able to take part in crushing the grapes by foot, just as it has always been done.

Would you be able to suggest any name? There is no restriction about genre or time period (from Beethoven onward everything is good!). As long as I can find some reliable source of information about their wine preference it would be great.

I'm about to set foot in this beautiful city for the first time. It's frankly a dream come true and I don't wanna mess it up for me and the lady, and my friends. 

So I figured I'd ask here for some tips on the best places to do the stuff we wanna do. I've gone through the guides in the side-bar but it feels a bit... lacking in personal touch. So I would welcome your suggestions for the following! I would like to:

- Eat amazing fried chicken. No matter where, fine dining or some cart in the street, I do not care. 
- Eat amazing shaved fried catfish.
- Discover creole cuisine, the real deal and maybe a nice modern take on it, or an interesting fusion creole restaurant.
- Drink fabulous whiskey, bourbon, rye. I know Louisiana has a few distilleries and I wanna sample some fine liquor. 
- Find THE winebar of the city. I'm a winemaker and winelover, and I'd like to treat my friends. Somewhere the wine list is never-ending, and where you can find nice little gems. 
- Go to a classy, upscale jazz club. Not 'wear your sunday best'-classy but something nice.
- Go to a more 'anything goes' kinda of place for a wild night of music, no matter the genre. If possible in a safe neighborhood. We're a bit scared of the gun violence in the US, regrettably.
- See the least touristy, hidden sights of the city. Like that little hole in the wall every resident should know, or this nice little spot where jazz history was made, you get the point. 
- Have a bayou experience, maybe an airboat? 

I think that's about it, off the top of my head, but feel free to advise me further, as I am sure this list must seem like the quintessential tourist's to-do list! But those 9 days have gotta count.

The ancient **Egyptian myth** of the snake Apep that attacks the boat of the Sun god is believed now to refer to **solar eclipses,** . They used this opportunity to cast prosperity and power spells. The Chinese and the Incas used magical practices to ward of misfortune.

 (EN)  
🥂 White dessert wine Muscat is truly a pearl in the collection of wines of the famous Georgian producer Chateau Mukhrani located in the wine region of Kakheti.  
🍇This attractive bright aromatic wine is made from the Italian variety Moscato Bianco, the seedlings of which were brought and carefully planted in the vineyards of the estate at the beginning of the 2️⃣0️⃣0️⃣0️⃣s, during the revival of the economy.  
To obtain a unique taste, a complex preparation technology goes through.  
ℹ️Grapes for making Muscat-Chateau Mukhrani are harvested only by hand from pre-cut vines, on which only the best grapes remain at the time of harvest.  
After sorting and soft pressing, the resulting wort is macerated for a long time so that the future wine becomes as aromatic and bright as possible.  
The fermentation that has begun is stopped according to the traditional method of making dessert wines by adding grape alcohol produced here on the estate.  
Thanks to this, Muscat Chateau Mukhrani wine achieves a strength of 1️⃣8️⃣% alcohol, which is rare for modern wines, while retaining an amazing Muscat aroma and sweetness.  
👉Excerpt wine takes place in oak tanks with seasonal changes in ambient temperature, which makes it stable and fills with a rich taste.  
The Mukhrani region is rich in its oak forests. The name Mukhrani comes from the root fly, which means oak in Georgian.  
The history of the Chateau Mukhrani estate dates back to the middle of the 19th century, when a descendant of a noble Georgian dynasty, Prince Ivane Mukhrabatoni, took up winemaking in his family estate Mukhrani.  
✅Oily, powerful rounded taste of wine is filled with chocolate and spicy nuances, turning into a long warm, even aftertaste.  
✅In a bright varietal aroma, nuances of figs, prunes, intertwining with oak and herbal notes, as well as hints of spices, are clearly traced.

ℹ️Graphen für die Herstellung von Muscat-Chateau Mukhrani werden nur von Hand aus vorgeschnittenen Reben geerntet, auf denen zum Zeitpunkt der Ernte nur die besten Trauben übrig bleiben.  
Nach dem Sortieren und sanften Pressen wird die resultierende Würze lange Zeit mazeriert, damit der zukünftige Wein so aromatisch und hell wie möglich wird.  
Die begonnene Gärung wird nach der traditionellen Methode der Herstellung von Dessertweinen durch Zugabe von Traubenalkohol gestoppt, der hier auf dem Weingut hergestellt wird.

Die Geschichte des Schlosses Mukhrani reicht bis in die Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts zurück, als ein Nachkomme einer edlen georgischen Dynastie, Prinz Ivane Mukhrabatoni, die Weinherstellung in seinem Familiengut Mukhrani aufnahm.  
✅Der ölige, kraftvolle, abgerundete Weingeschmack ist mit Schokolade und würzigen Nuancen gefüllt und verwandelt sich in einen langen, warmen, gleichmäßigen Nachgeschmack.

The idea originally came up while I was looking to find out about the wineries in Greece, their products and their location. Unfortunately, I found that the available data was inadequate and usually related to the popular wineries displayed on wine websites. This was the case until I discovered a PDO / PGI Winemaking Registry: a simple excel file with no mechanical readability of this public information, negating the possibility of being classified as ""open data"". So, I proceeded to a mass processing of the data of this Registry, with the harder point of manually locating each winery separately. It was a time-consuming task but led to a total of nearly 700 wineries with detailed data and geographic location. The next thought was: Who needs this data? Who wants to know where each winery is located? The answer was: whoever wants to visit the wineries.

Here lies the central idea of the application: the winelover can browse the map, explore the wineries and plan a winery visit route or follow a proposed route. If he/she has visited wineries, he/she can record his/her view of them, as well as save his/her routes. Each route is designed, based on an algorithm, based on shortest distance or shorter duration. The long-term goal of the application is to promote wine tourism not only for the popular but for all wineries in Greece, giving the opportunity to show new winemakers as well as to promote the Greek wine worldwide as the application is not only for Greece but for all winelovers.

The app is officially released and available for free at [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.phonegap.wineroutes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.phonegap.wineroutes). More details can be found on the application's website at [wineroutes.eu](http://wineroutes.eu/). I would be glad if you tried out the app and offered any advice/remarks about the content. Who knows?

 Pardon my English, as I do struggle with the writing of it.

In a manifesting aspect, greatness alludes to the part of God’s inclination and force which is completely autonomous of the material universe, past every single actual law. This is diverged from nature, where a divine being is supposed to be completely present in the actual world and consequently open to animals differently. In strict experience greatness is a condition of being that has conquered the impediments of actual presence and by certain definitions has likewise gotten autonomous of it. This is regularly showed in petition, séance, contemplation, hallucinogens' and paranormal “dreams”.

It is attested in different strict customs’ idea of the perfect, which diverges from the thought of a divine being (or, the Supreme) that exists solely in the actual request (immanentism), or unclear from it (polytheism). Amazing quality can be ascribed to the awesome in its being, yet in addition in its information. Hence, God may rise above both the universe and information (is outside the ability to understand of the human psyche).

In way of thinking, amazing quality is the fundamental ground idea from the word’s strict importance (from Latin), of climbing or going past, yet with fluctuating undertones in its diverse chronicled and social stages. It incorporates methods of reasoning, frameworks, and approaches that portray the principal structures of being, not as a philosophy (hypothesis of being), but rather as the system of rise and approval of information on being. “Supernatural” is a word gotten from the academic, assigning the extra-unmitigated ascribes of creatures.

A transcendental wish is what rises above our own cognizance: that which is objective as opposed to just a wonder of awareness, Subsequently making everything conceivable.

In the otherworldly world, “supernatural” has limitless force and more hugeness than “most noteworthy”. “Highest” is utilized huge number of times by customary individuals in varying backgrounds, though “supernatural” has been utilized in a more confined way. The most elevated Force is higher than all the other things. The supernatural Force is what rises above everything. There isn’t anything above it.

# Stonehenge, the Winter Solstice, and Ancient powers.

The stones of Stonehenge have silently marked the winter solstice for thousands of years. The Winter Solstice marks the return of the Sun. The Druids and people from around the world gather at Stonehenge to celebrate the midwinter and welcome longer days. The winter solstice is important that prehistoric people built this extraordinary monument.

The Winter Solstice is the most important day of the year at Stonehenge. Stonehenge is the great prehistoric stone circle set in a complex prehistoric landscape in Wiltshire, England which is built on a solstitial alignment.

The celebration of the Winter Solstice brings together England's New Age Tribes such as the neo-Druids, the neo-Pagans, and the Wiccans with tourist and travelers from around the world who come to Stonehenge to celebrate and experience the Winter Solstice. 

The earth rotates on a tilted axis. When this axis leans towards the sun, it’s summer in the northern hemisphere and winter in the south. This is reversed as the earth continues on its orbit until the axis becomes tilted away from the sun.

During the solstice, the earth’s axis is tilted at its furthest point from the sun. This means that, for us in the northern hemisphere, the sun is at its lowest point in the sky. It’s also the shortest day of the year - and the longest night.

🍷Oyalshi is one of the most popular red table Georgian wines.  
Ojaleshi has won two gold and one silver medals at international wine competitions and exhibitions.  
🍇Ojaleshi wine is made from the Ojaleshi grape variety.  
The main place of its cultivation is the Tsalenjikha, Gegechkori, Tsageri and Zugdidi regions of Georgia.  
These areas are called a real deposit of semi-dry and semi-sweet wines.  
👉The most fertile areas are vineyards, which are located along the banks of the Tskhensitskali and the Rioni River.  
Plantations in these places are located at an altitude of about 700-800 meters above sea level.

🍷Одним из самых популярных красных столовых грузинских вин является Оялеши.  
На международных винных конкурсах и выставках Оджалеши заработало две золотые и одну серебряную медаль.  
🍇Вино Оджалеши изготавливают из сорта винограда оджалеши.  
Главным местом его культивации являются Цаленджихский, Гегечкорский, Цагерский, Зугдидский районы Грузии.  
Эти районы называют настоящим месторождением полусухих и полусладких вин.  
👉Самыми плодоносными зонами являются виноградники, которые расположены вдоль берегов реки Цхенсицкали и реки Риони.  
Плантации в этих местах расположены на высоте примерно 700-800 метров над уровнем моря.  
ℹВино славится своей длинной историей. Изготавливать его начали ещё в 1933 году.  
Отличительной чертой в изготовлении именно грузинских полусухих и полусладких вин является то, что сусло (выжитый сок из ягод и фруктов) охлаждают до температуры 0 градусов, чтобы дрожжевые бактерии полностью потеряли свою активность и выпали в осадок. После этого сусло процеживают.  
✅Вкус вина Оджалеши очень приятный, сладковатый, открывает неповторимый ароматный букет спелых фруктов. Ярче всего ощущается вкус сливы и шелковицы. А послевкусие вина остаётся надолго!

🥂 Chotiashvili Khikhvi Rcheuli Kvevri - an exquisite, light, refreshing wine made from light technical Khikhvi - an ancient autochthonous Georgian variety.  
ℹKhikhvi is a very interesting variety that is suitable for making a variety of wines. For example, both dry and dessert wines from Khikhvi that have been collected in Kardanakhi can be made. This is an extremely rare property, and of all Kakheti, only Khikhvi gives a similar opportunity. It cannot remain assembled in the vineyard for a long time, and this is of particular importance. Sugar accumulates in large quantities in Khikhvi, and there have been cases in which its sugar content has reached 35%.  
Khikhvi wine has rich mineral tones and this distinguishes this variety from others. The first mention of this grape dates from the third century.  
🍇The vineyard where the vines grow is located in one of the most popular wine-growing regions in Georgia - Kakheti.  
The method of making wine in special clay amphora called Kvevri is also considered unique and ancient.  
The vinification and aging of the drink in original containers, which are placed underground, preserves its phenolicity in the wine, removes excess acid and gives an unforgettable taste and aroma.  
👉This refined drink was created by the small Chotiashvili winery, which despite its relatively young age is known not only in Georgia but also far beyond its borders.  
✅ The wine is characterized by a beautiful straw yellow color. The refined, refined bouquet shows a bright, aromatic character, filled with accents of peaches, apricots and apples, which are emphasized by light notes of ginger, honey and herbs. Refreshing, elegant, rich and harmonious, the taste reveals a pleasant, balanced acidity.

🥂 Chotiashvili Khikhvi Rcheuli Kvevri - ein exquisiter, leichter, erfrischender Wein, der aus dem leichten technischen Khikhvi hergestellt wird - einer alten autochthonen georgischen Sorte.  
ℹKhikhvi ist eine sehr interessante Sorte, die sich zur Herstellung einer Vielzahl von Weinen eignet. Zum Beispiel können sowohl Trocken- als auch Dessertweine aus Khikhvi hergestellt werden, die in Kardanakhi gesammelt wurden. Dies ist eine äußerst seltene Eigenschaft, und von allen Kachetien gibt nur Khikhvi eine ähnliche Gelegenheit. Es kann lange Zeit im Weinberg nicht zusammengebaut bleiben, und dies ist auch von besonderer Bedeutung. In Khikhvi reichert sich Zucker in großen Mengen an, es gab Fälle, in denen sein Zuckergehalt 35% erreichte.  
Khikhvi-Wein hat reiche Mineraltöne und dies unterscheidet diese Sorte auch von anderen. Die erste Erwähnung dieser Traube stammt aus dem dritten Jahrhundert.  
🍇Der Weinberg, in dem die Reben wachsen, befindet sich in einem der beliebtesten Weinanbaugebiete Georgiens - Kachetien.  
Die Methode der Weinherstellung in speziellen Tonamphoren namens Kvevri gilt ebenfalls als einzigartig und uralt.  
Die Weinbereitung und Alterung des Getränks in Originalgefäßen, die unter die Erde gestellt werden, bewahrt seine Phenolizität im Wein, entfernt überschüssige Säure und verleiht einen unvergesslichen Geschmack und ein unvergessliches Aroma.  
👉Dieses raffinierte Getränk wurde von dem kleinen Weingut Chotiashvili kreiert, das trotz seines relativ jungen Alters nicht nur in Georgien, sondern auch weit über seine Grenzen hinaus bekannt ist.  
✅ Der Wein zeichnet sich durch einen schönen strohgelben Farbton aus. Das raffinierte, raffinierte Bouquet zeigt einen hellen, aromatischen Charakter, gefüllt mit Akzenten von Pfirsichen, Aprikosen und Äpfeln, die durch leichte Noten von Ingwer, Honig und Kräutern hervorgehoben werden. Erfrischend, elegant, reich und harmonisch, offenbart der Geschmack eine angenehme, ausgewogene Säure.

🥂 Чотиашвили Хихви Рчеули Квеври – изысканное, легкое, освежающее вино, которое создается из светлого технического сорта Хихви – который является древним автохтонным грузинским сортом.  
ℹХихви – весьма интересный сорт, он подходит для изготовления разнообразных вин. К примеру, из Хихви, собранного в Карданахи может быть приготовлено как сухое, так и десертное вино. Это крайне редкое свойство и из всех кахетинских сортов лишь Хихви дает подобную возможность. Он может долго оставаться несобранным в винограднике, и это также имеет особое значение. В Хихви в большом количестве накапливаются сахара, бывали случаи, когда его сахаристость достигала 35%.  
Вино Хихви обладает насыщенными минеральными тонами и это также отличает этот сорт от других. Первые упоминания об этом винограде дотированы еще третьим веком.  
🍇Виноградник, на котором произрастают лозы, расположен в одном из популярных винодельческих регионов Грузии – Кахетии.  
Уникальным и древним также считается способ производства вина в специальных глиняных амфорах, которые называются ''Kвеври''.  
Винификация и выдержка напитка в оригинальных сосудах, которые помещены под землю, сохраняют в вине его фенольность, убирает лишнюю кислотность и придает незабываемый вкус и аромат.  
👉Создан этот утонченный напиток небольшой винодельней Чотиашвили , которая не взирая на достаточно молодой возраст, уже известна не только в Грузии, но и далеко за ее пределами.  
✅Вино характеризуется красивым соломенно-желтым оттенком. В утонченном, изысканном букете раскрывается яркий ароматический характер, наполненный акцентами персиков, абрикосов, яблок, которые подчеркнуты легкими оттенками имбиря, меда и трав. Освежающий, элегантный, богатый и гармоничный вкус раскрывается приятной хорошо сбалансированной кислотностью.

🍷 '' Saperavi Muscat '' from Askaneli Brothers - Very interesting red wine.  
🍇To make this wine, combining the sweetness of white Muscat and the velvety astringency of red Saperavi, a unique technology was developed by the Askaneli Brothers winemakers.  
The grapes are harvested at optimum maturity. For fermentation, temperature-controlled steel vats are used.  
ℹThe story of the Askaneli brothers began in 1️⃣8️⃣8️⃣0️⃣ in the village of Askana in the region of Guria.  
Today ""Askaneli Brothers"" is a successful company that employs the best Georgian winemakers, and uses progressive technologies to create wines.  
✅ Wine Saperavi Muscat ruby ​​color with purple reflections.  
An elegant, complex, voluminous aroma of the wine reveals hints of wildflowers, dried apricots, roses, honey and raisins.

All the bookcases are just stacked on top of each other with the use of nothing but gravity and some small pieces of wood in the bottom to keep it all in level. All of it can be easily disassembled. The cases a raw and untreated and I love the way they look after years of sun and wear and tear.

I have been doing this winecase Tetris for years and it is amazing how many ways you can redecorate your home with these cases.

I hope, you like it and that you may find some inspiration to decorate your home in a creative wineloving way.

🍷Perfectly balanced Georgian wine, made from Saperavi grapes, which grows in the Kvareli-Kakheti region.  
Saperavi red wine is one of the most outstanding wines in Georgia.  
ℹIn translation ""saperavi"" means paint, which confirms the key feature of both grape varieties and wine.  
🍇 The Saperavi grape is extremely malleable in terms of technological processes. Almost any wine can be made from it (semi-sweet, dessert, dry, liqueur).  
👉 Harvesting is carried out exclusively by hand. After pressing and fermenting the wort in stainless steel tanks, the wine is aged partly in oak barrels and partly in Kvevri-clay jugs, which are almost completely buried in the ground.  
✅ The wine has a dark ruby ​​color with dark blue tints.  
The aromatic bouquet of the wine is replete with notes of juicy mulberry, notes of blackberry and vigny.  
ℹThe history of the Askaneli brothers began in the village of Askana in the region of Guria, where the first winemaking recorded there dates back to 1880 by the ancestors of the Askaneli brothers.  
Eighteen years ago, the brothers returned to the practice of their ancestors, founding a company and revitalizing wine production in the hopes of inspiring the growth of Georgian wine culture internationally.

🍷 Perfekt ausbalancierter georgischer Wein aus Saperavi-Trauben, der in der Region Kvareli-Kakheti wächst.  
Saperavi Rotwein ist einer der herausragendsten Weine in Georgien.  
ℹIn der Übersetzung bedeutet ""saperavi"" Farbe, die das Hauptmerkmal sowohl der Rebsorten als auch des Weins bestätigt.  
🍇 Die Saperavi-Traube ist hinsichtlich technologischer Prozesse äußerst formbar. Fast jeder Wein kann daraus hergestellt werden (halbsüß, Dessert, trocken, Likör).  
👉 Die Ernte erfolgt ausschließlich von Hand. Nach dem Pressen und Fermentieren der Würze in Edelstahltanks reift der Wein teilweise in Eichenfässern und teilweise in Kvevri-Tonkrügen, die fast vollständig im Boden vergraben sind.  
✅ Der Wein hat eine dunkle rubinrote Farbe mit dunkelblauen Reflexen.  
Das aromatische Bouquet des Weins ist voll mit Noten von saftiger Maulbeere, Noten von Brombeere und Vigny.  
ℹDie Geschichte der Askaneli-Brüder begann im Dorf Askana in der Region Guria, wo die erste Weinherstellung, die dort aufgezeichnet wurde, von den Vorfahren der Askaneli-Brüder aus dem Jahr 1880 stammt.  
Vor achtzehn Jahren kehrten die Brüder in die Praxis ihrer Vorfahren zurück, gründeten ein Unternehmen und belebten die Weinproduktion in der Hoffnung, das Wachstum der georgischen Weinkultur international zu fördern.

🍇Bиноград Саперави чрезвычайно податливый в плане технологических процессов. Из него можно изготовлять практически любое вино (полусладкое, десертное, сухое, ликёрное).  
👉Сбор урожая проводится исключительно вручную,После прессования и ферментации сусла в емкостях из нержавеющей стали-вино выдерживают частично в дубовых бочках, а частично в Kвеври-глиняных кувшины, которые почти полностью закапываются в землю.

The idea originally came up while I was looking to find out about the wineries in Greece, their products and their location. Unfortunately, I found that the available data was inadequate and usually related to the popular wineries displayed on wine websites. This was the case until I discovered a PDO / PGI Winemaking Registry: a simple excel file with no mechanical readability of this public information, negating the possibility of being classified as ""open data"". So, I proceeded to a mass processing of the data of this Registry, with the harder point of manually locating each winery separately. It was a time-consuming task but led to a total of nearly 700 wineries with detailed data and geographic location. The next thought was: Who needs this data? Who wants to know where each winery is located? The answer was: whoever wants to visit the wineries.

Here lies the central idea of the application: the winelover can browse the map, explore the wineries and plan a winery visit route or follow a proposed route. If he/she has visited wineries, he/she can record his/her view of them, as well as save his/her routes. Each route is designed, based on an algorithm, based on shortest distance or shorter duration. The long-term goal of the application is to promote wine tourism not only for the popular but for all wineries in Greece, giving the opportunity to show new winemakers as well as to promote the Greek wine worldwide as the application is not only for Greece but for all winelovers.

The app is officially released and available for free at [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.phonegap.wineroutes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.phonegap.wineroutes). More details can be found on the application's website at [wineroutes.eu](http://wineroutes.eu/). I would be glad if you tried out the app and offered any advice/remarks about the content. Who knows?

 (EN)  
🍷Famous American magazine Esquire has made Georgian wine Tavkveri one of the best natural wines in the world.  
Tavkveri is a bright wine that is made from the autochthonous Georgian red grapes of the Tavkveri variety, mainly grown in the Kartli region, where the winery with the poetic name “Tears of the Pheasant” is located.  
ℹ Vines of this species are thermophilic and even ripen late in hot climates. In addition, for the formation of balanced acidity in the berries, an optimal combination of day and night temperatures, abundant irrigation and the presence of a special complex of substances in the soils are necessary.  
🍇 Red wine from Tavkveri has always been present on the tables of Georgian kings, today it is produced exclusively by ""Pheasant's Tears"".  
👉To obtain wine, the method of fermenting the wort is used in large earthenware jugs-Kvevri, which are almost completely buried in the ground - thus ensuring a constant temperature regime.  
The wine cellar “Tears of Pheasant” produces natural wine, taking into account the ancient Georgian traditions. The name of the cellar comes from a Georgian legend, the hero of which claims that only wine can make a pheasant cry with joy.  
✅Tavkveri wine has a light, juicy taste with velvety tannins and a fresh aroma with nuances of red currant, raspberry, rose hips, rose petals and red fruits.

Tavkveri ist ein heller Wein, der aus autochthonen georgischen roten Trauben der Sorte Tavkveri hergestellt wird, die hauptsächlich in der Region Kartli angebaut werden, wo sich das Weingut mit dem poetischen Namen „Tränen des Fasans“ befindet.  
ℹ Reben dieser Art sind thermophil und reifen in heißen Klimazonen sogar spät. Darüber hinaus ist für die Bildung einer ausgewogenen Säure in den Beeren eine optimale Kombination von Tag- und Nachttemperaturen, reichlicher Bewässerung und dem Vorhandensein eines speziellen Substanzkomplexes in den Böden erforderlich.  
🍇 Rotwein aus Tavkveri war schon immer auf den Tischen georgischer Könige vertreten, heute wird er ausschließlich von ""Fasanentränen"" hergestellt.  
👉Um Wein zu erhalten, wird die Methode zur Fermentation der Würze in großen Tonkrügen (Kvevri) angewendet, die fast vollständig im Boden vergraben sind, wodurch ein konstantes Temperaturregime gewährleistet wird.  
Der Weinkeller „Tränen des Fasans“ produziert natürlichen Wein unter Berücksichtigung der alten georgischen Traditionen. Der Name des Kellers stammt von einer georgischen Legende, deren Held behauptet, dass nur Wein einen Fasan vor Freude zum Weinen bringen kann.

🍷Известный американский журнал Esquire внес грузинское вино «Тавквери» в число лучших натуральных вин мира.  
Тавквери— яркое вино, которое изготавливается из автохтонного красного грузинского винограда сорта Тавквери, в основном произрастающего в регионе Картли, где и расположена винодельня с поэтическим названием ""Слезы фазана"".  
ℹ Лозы данного вида отличаются теплолюбивостью и даже в жарком климате вызревают поздно. Кроме того, для формирования в ягодах сбалансированной кислотности необходимо оптимальное сочетание дневных и ночных температур, обильное орошение и наличие в почвах специального комплекса веществ.  
🍇Красное вино из Тавквери всегда присутствовало на столах грузинских царей, сегодня его производит исключительно ""Pheasant's Tears"".  
👉Для получения вина применяется метод браживания сусла в больших глиняных кувшинах-квеври, которые почти полностью закапываются в землю — таким образом обеспечивается постоянный температурный режим.  
Винный погреб «Слезы Фазана» производит натуральное вино с учетом древних грузинских традиций. Название погреба идет от грузинской легенды, герой которой утверждает, что только вино может заставить фазана плакать от радости.  
✅Вино Тавквери отличает легкий, сочный вкус с бархатистыми танинами и свежий аромат с нюансами красной смородины, малины, шиповника, розовых лепестков и красных фруктов.

*Wine Routes* is the social media for winelovers. Its central idea is that any winelover can browse the map, explore the wineries and plan a path for wineries or follow a proposed route. If they have visited any wineries, they can record their view of them, as well as save their routes. Each route is designed, based on an algorithm, for the shortest distance or shorter duration. The long-term goal of the application is to promote wine tourism not only for the popular but for all wineries in Greece, giving the opportunity to attract new winemakers as well as to promote the Greek wine worldwide as the application is not only for Greece but for all winelovers.

Now that you read all you need to keep with our up until now course, here are the characteristics added with the new version:

* You can now review wines for wineries included in the app. If the winery is in the map, you can write about its wine with reference to its attributes (color, smell, appearance, taste etc).
* User profile is much enriched with avatar, short description, wines you like and wines you dislike, your winery reviews, your wine reviews and your saved routes. Users can also view their routes and reviewed wineries on the map, thus creating a visualization of their trips.
* Winery profile is also enriched with much information as well as with the reviews created by all users for it or its wines.
* You can now choose among ten (10) languages: English, Greek, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese and Japanese. The plan is to add more languages on a latter production stage.

The idea originally came up while I was looking to find out about the wineries in Greece, their products and their location. Unfortunately, I found that the available data was inadequate and usually related to the popular wineries displayed on wine websites. This was the case until I discovered a PDO / PGI Winemaking Registry: a simple excel file with no mechanical readability of this public information, negating the possibility of being classified as ""open data"". So, I proceeded to a mass processing of the data of this Registry, with the harder point of manually locating each winery separately. It was a time-consuming task but led to a total of nearly 700 wineries with detailed data and geographic location. The next thought was: Who needs this data? Who wants to know where each winery is located? The answer was: whoever wants to visit the wineries.

Here lies the central idea of the application: the winelover can browse the map, explore the wineries and plan a winery visit route or follow a proposed route. If he/she has visited wineries, he/she can record his/her view of them, as well as save his/her routes. Each route is designed, based on an algorithm, based on shortest distance or shorter duration. The long-term goal of the application is to promote wine tourism not only for the popular but for all wineries in Greece, giving the opportunity to show new winemakers as well as to promote the Greek wine worldwide as the application is not only for Greece but for all winelovers.

The app is officially released and available for free at [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.phonegap.wineroutes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.phonegap.wineroutes). More details can be found on the application's website at [wineroutes.eu](http://wineroutes.eu/). I would be glad if you tried out the app and offered any advice/remarks about the content. Who knows?

 I have wanted to expand my palate and explore new wines. Vintage Wine and Eats in Studio City answered my goals with their truly unique selection of wines. ⠀  
⠀  
I have never heard of a Semi-sparkling Orange Wine before and was overly excited to get this wine from Grace. From Northern Grace, Ioannina is a small wine region with only two wineries. Paleokerisio Meaning ""old fashioned"" revives the well-known traditional semi-sparkling wine of Ioannina. A blend of Indigenous grapes; Debina, Vlahiko, and Bekari. These grapes go through skin contact before fermentation, resulting in a light amber orange color. ⠀  
⠀  
Ioannina is about 2300 feet above sea level on the western slopes of Pindos, these slops receive about 40 inches of rain, lucky for us the vineyards are mainly sunny with steeply inclined slopes, sandy loam soil and have outstanding natural drainage. ⠀  
⠀  
👀: Golden amber⠀  
⠀  
👃🏻: apple cider, Campari or amaro element like bitter orange and bittersweet herbs⠀  
⠀  
👅: baked pear/apple, orange peels, clove and mountain spices⠀  
⠀  
Paired this with Korean style meatballs, rice, and roasted vegetables. The herbs and sweet Korean BBQ sauce worked really while with the bubbles of the wine.⠀  
⠀  
Highly recommend trying this wine. ⠀

Two years ago I had the honor of being attending a party for the 40th birthday and departure to the US of a wine connoisseur in Gevrey, France. Together with a friend we drove my old convertible through the French Jura, down from Geneva to Gevrey, where we started the day at the Rotisserie du Chambertin in Gevrey. We started with a vintage champagne, before moving on to a gorgeous Gevrey Chambertin 2009. We ended with a nice Givry en Veille Vignes, a 2013, young but promising.

After this, we retired to the hotel to prepare for the evening. Our participatory gifts were 3 large boxes of Cuban Cigars, I had a selection of Swiss Pinot Noirs and my friend brought a vertical tasting of Chateauneuf du Pape, covering 9 years of which 3 were also horizontally covered. 

We arrived at the old farm; the residence of our host and were greeted by a crowd of roughly 100 people; evenly split up between the largests winegrowing families of the region and winelovers from all over the world. Tables were laid out with tens of differents styles of cigards; others held massive buffets of cheese (whole wheels) and Charcuterie. But the most impressive sight we were greeted by was the 2 old convent tables, loaded down with hundreds of the best wines I have ever seen. Whites, Reds, Champagnes, French, Italian, ... everything was present and available, brought by the assorted guests ...

That night I got to drink, amongst others:
2004 Romanee-Conti
2011 Cuvee Emilie Hermitage
2012 No.3
1999 Chapelle-CHambertin Grand Cru Trapet
2009 Chablis Grand Cru Blanchot
2001 Visan La Tine
2006 Visan La Tine
1945 Barolo (drinkable!)
2011 Pessac-Leognan Grand Cru CLasse 
1945 Alicante Montagnac
2007 Chevalier Montrachet Grand Cru ....

There were tens of other bottles there I did not drink from and at least 30 I did drink from, but have no pics of. Proof of the above: Doomser on Vivino is my account.

I was at my mothers home a few days ago and was speaking to her about the teething issues. My mom does some old fashion things and she’s really into herbs and natural healing and such, so she wanted to try rubbing whiskey on my daughters gums. She said she did it to me and all 3 of my siblings. I let her, and it did seem to calm my daughter down a bit. 

  When I got home I told my husband about this, and he was furious. He said that’s harmful to our daughter and it does not relieve any pain. He got really upset and said I shouldn’t of let my mom do something like that, and told me I couldn’t bring our daughter to my mothers anymore.

He’s since called the next 2 days off of work, and is super paranoid watching me every second with our daughter.

Classification: Tennessee Whiskey

Company: Brown-Forman

Distillery: Jack Daniel Distillery

Release Date: March 2023

Proof: 107

Age: 12 Years

Mashbill: 80% Corn, 12% Rye, 8% Malted Barley

Color: Dark Leather

Price Paid: $119.99 

I don’t think I’ve seen a bad review for this bottle so I was incredibly excited to see what was going on with this release. Let’s get into it.

Nose: Sweet pipe tobacco, burnt sugar, leather, sweet oak, bananas foster 

Palate: A warm and viscous coating, wow, can’t believe it’s only 107 proof. Dark, burnt sugar, toasted coconut, more bananas foster, vanilla extract, deep.

Finish: Long, warm, sweet oak, dark fruits, vanilla extract, not overly complex but long and balanced.

For a fresh neck pour, this bottle has really blown me away. I can’t wait to see how this opens up and it’s gonna be hard to make it last that long. It’s not a super complex whiskey but it has the sweet and dark notes that I love and manages to concentrate them into what I’d consider my perfect pour. Truly astounding.

I have such a fun collaboration to present to you all today. The talented u/WhiskeyTanFox101 posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildaudio/comments/zmkuhz/ffff4m_script_offer_pokey_pokey_literotica_club/) collaboration script, and I immediately contacted my awesome friends u/allie_dreamweaver, u/CatEyeSpecks, and u/Pirate_Friend_67 to see if they'd like to record it. They were all on board, and here we are! We have one introduction audio with all four of us, and then we each have an individual audio for our parts. I really hope you enjoy this, and please remember to give Allie, Cat, Pirate, and especially Whiskey lots of love!

# Introduction

featuring 😏, 🤭, 😉, and ☺️

You told your best friend Sarah about wanting to try a new creative pursuit, and she shares her hobby of writing and sharing erotica on a website called Literotica. After discussing it for a while, and even trying your hand at a short NSFW story, Sarah's invited you to an erotic literature club that she organizes with three friends - Mona, Miri, and Nat. She just happens to be hosting this month’s meeting, and it’s coming up this weekend, if you're interested….

\-{MONA} is a shameless flirt. That, combined with her large breasts and confident demeanour are a potent combination that usually gets her what she wants. She’s the most outgoing member of the group. Her…friendliness made quite an impression on you, so when she mentioned that she’d love to give you detailed feedback on your short story, you took her up on the offer right away and invited her over to your place.

\-{MIRI} is a shy goth who seems to always be putting her foot in her mouth in conversation. Most people would describe her as thoughtful and friendly, but a bit awkward and quite self-conscious. She has a passion for books and writing. You expressed an interest in writing romantic stories like hers, so she invited you over this evening to discuss further.

\-{NAT}’s cuteness and high energy make her naturally approachable. Amongst friends, she is confident and sassy, and embraces her love of anime, superheroes, and comic books. You and she appear to have some unresolved business between you. If only you could remember why. She’s graciously invited you to come over this afternoon – ostensibly to talk about her process for writing fanfics, but you also really want to know why she seems to dislike you so much.

{SARAH} has been the listener’s best friend since childhood. She is a lighthearted tomboy who is a bit on the goofy side. She’s a bit sporty and a lot nerdy. She’s been secretly in love with the listener for almost a year, and has so far been unwilling to risk their friendship over what she assumes is unrequited love. Instead of getting to know one of the other girls, the listener decided to hang out with his best friend. This weekend starts out the same as many others before; they’re having some beers on her sofa, watching the game….

For context remote users use SonicWall VPN and my experience is the fastest fix is a simple reboot.  Emailed instructions; will send texts if asked; I will even take a phone call and politely explain to reboot. ""Hey just reboot and your issue will be solved.

After a few minutes The number of times I hear  the words ""Did that; same error"" only to find their uptime being over a day is increasingly annoying.

Bike is an All City Space Horse I had custom built. Wheels are Whiskey No.9 rims laced to Chris King 28h hubs (rear, SRAM XDR) 24h (front). Not sure if it makes a difference but the drivetrain is SRAM Force AXS. I’m roughly 180-200lbs depending on the time of year.

It seems every time I ride (which has been more road/canal paths than actual gravel/light singletrack because I’m afraid to take these wheels on anything aggressive) I have an issue. These wheels were originally setup with aluminum nipples but the nipples kept breaking. Finally replaced the front wheel with brass nipples and that seems to be holding. I just retaped the wheels and got everything ready for a longer ride last week, went out for a test run and blew a rear aluminum nipple. Took it into the shop and had them replace all the aluminum with brass nipples, run new spokes, etc and today on my first ride, I broke a spoke again. 

I honestly don’t know what could be causing this. I’ve had two different bike shops rebuild these wheels and they still have issues. Was thinking maybe the first shop wasn’t the smartest at building wheels but now having the same issue again after a new shop built this rear wheel. 

Am I too heavy for the wheel set?
Could it be the spokes being used (pretty sure they’re dt Swiss something or other)?
Is something not being installed right. 

This is all incredibly frustrating as I’ve had several wheels custom built over the years and these are the only rims I’ve had problems with.

My whole family came to my and my GF's appartment last Saturday for my birthday party: my parents, some aunts and uncles, some cousins, my 3 brothers with their families, my two kids (and my GF's 15yro son who lives with us). 

I am a recovered alcoholic, I've been sober for 6 years now. Alcohol absolutely ruined my life, it destroyed my marriage and nuked my relationship with my kids for years. I don't allow alcohol in my home now, for anyone. It just isn't served or tolerated here. My entire family knows this very well, as they know my entire history with alcohol. 

For my 40th, my brother bought me a very expensive bottle of whiskey, it had writing on it, a very heavy bottle and very old whiskey, so it probably cost him a couple hundred bucks. 

When he gave me the bottle, I was shocked, and said I don't drink, but thanks for the gift. He then opened the bottle and started pouring shots in plastic cups for everyone. My daughter had a panic attack at the smell of the alcohol (which I am painfully aware is my fault and I will never forgive myself for it), so I told my brother to take the alcohol out on the balcony and just leave it there. He wouldn't do it, and took a shot of the whiskey. 

I told him to seriously stop it and he proceeded to pour the whiskey. He then said I am acting like a sober saint now, when I ruined everyone's birthdays for years with my drinking. I told him to come to the hallway with me and talk it out. He refused and put a glass of whiskey in my hand. 

I took the trash can, threw the whiskey bottle in it and the plastic cups, and took the trash out. 

My brother then stormed off and my mom followed him. She later called me, demanding an apology for disrespecting my brother like that. My dad said I was being overly sensitive, and some of my other family members also agree.

He has this cupboard with lots of bottles and thats where I store my vodka and gin sometimes. He is okay with me having his alcohol and I allow him to have mine too if he has friends around. Unfortunately one day I made a dumb decision that I really regret. 

A few weeks ago I saw his bottle of whiskey in the cupboard that somebody customly made a cover around with star trek things. It was most likely a birthday present from a friend of his and he would've wanted to keep it with the rest of his collection.

I had no alcohol and didn't want to spend money on more and at first I thought the bottle was already open but when I twisted it I heard a click and I knew I had opened it for the first time. I poured myself some anyway, closed it and put it back in the cupboard. I know it is going to go off eventually and if he ever wants to drink it on a special occasion it will be vrot and he'll get really upset. I really really don't want to tell him what I did but I also know that at some point in the future this will come back to get me.

Original post:

&amp;#x200B;

Greetings from Germany,

I wanted to ask for some recommendations for liquors that are cheap but still decent quality for the price. Of course there already are plenty of recommendations online, but unfortunately, most of them recommend the same few brands, some of which are not available in german supermarkets OR are much more expensive here than in the States for example.

I already bought some spirits based on those lists, that are available here.

For example (and feel free to share your opinions, alternatives and correct me, if you think that I'm wrong), in terms of gin I've read that Gordon's is supposed to be decent for its price, for white rum I have Bacardi's Carta Blanca Superior and Havana Club 3 Anos, for Scotch I have Famous Grouse, and finding decent Vodka is no problem at all.

Dark rum and US whiskey on the other hand are more of a problem. For example, I've read that Plantation, Rittenhouse and Old Overholt are supposed to be good. But I couldn't find them in any store.

Now obviously, many of you won't know what brands are available in Germany, but it would be immensely helpful to have some recommendations that usually aren't on those top 10 budget liquors lists you can find online.

I would greatly apprecate your help, thanks for reading!",t2_635uw02fm,Budget liquors that are still decent?

**Summary of responses**

- Just get Everclear and dilute it (bruh)

- Choice of vodka doesn't matter when mixing

- Avoid *bottom shelf swill*; brands like Smirnoff and Absolut ~~aren't *that* bad~~ are fine

- Brands like Smirnoff and Absolut are *bottom shelf swill*; avoid brands that are ""triple-distilled"" or similar

- Vodka is *swill*; consider juniper-flavored vodka (gin) instead

When I ordered, it said it would arrive in 30 minutes. The money was deducted from my account. 

2 hours of constantly refreshing the page with the anxious, obsessive energy of the alcoholic I am, I contacted support.

They replied within minutes that my order had been declined because of a processing error, but they could try to resubmit the order if I replied confirming my card info, address, etc. If not, the order would become void and the charges would be released by my bank in 5-7 days. 

I'm not particularly spiritual, but something hit me at this moment and I decided this was guidance from the universe, or perhaps from my late parents who had pleaded with me to stop drinking many times.

I replied to the email that I'd like the order voided.

I'm now drinking ice water with ginger.

We also have a lot of rock bottom monsters just laying on the floor after they trusted a fart.

It's wild to think how thin that line is? We have a pretty intense homeless population in New Orleans and you drive bit and you're like ""shit that's wild, they have a grill and like a whole thing going on"" and it's one thing to see it from your car.

I've been having car problems and taking a lot of public transportation and I actually walked through the homeless village we have here and it really got me thinking how like so many of us are very very close to just like ""okay, got my tent, can't afford rent or mortgage"".

I know this isn't /r/poveryfinance but like damn, who wouldn't want to be drinking during this fucking nightmare version of life.

I try to frame it with optimism which is really hard because i could actually be a monster. Like Donald Trump was president, like seriously, we have zero rules now. Literal nazis are just coming out of the closet because it's okay.

Maybe this is a feature and not a bug. We almost recalled our mayor here in New Orleans and fuck it, let me do it. We had Donald Trump as president of the goddamn country, let me run New Orleans for a term. It'll be Mardi Gras pretty much 365 days a year, I'm going to rebuild Storyville and make Metairie pay for it. Weed? Oh yeah, we'll have weed. It's not legal on a state level but yo we got mad weed, holla.

It's been great, but I let him know from the outset that I was a recovering alcoholic. He had no problem with that, and he still drinks with his friends, but won't do that in my presence. It still bothers me that he drinks, but it's his life, I can't tell him what to do.

Fast forward to last Sunday, and we're at his apartment. I come in, and he's in the middle of making pasta sauce, and there's a large bottle of vodka on the counter. I didn't say anything about the bottle, but he saw me staring at it, and he told me it's for the sauce.

Pasta sauce he's made me at least twice a month for the entirety of our relationship.

He said he's told me from the beginning he does that, that it cooks away, but I think that would be something I would very much remember, and I got a little angry. I knocked the bottle off the counter and went to my mom's.

He's called and apologized for triggering me, and that he was being brainless, but he wants me to pay for the broken bottle, which he says was about an $80 brand. I told him that I wasn't under any circumstances going to pay for something he's been lacing my food with for years.

We haven't really talked since, and my mom wants me to just go ahead and buy the thing to make amends, and I'm still refusing. AITA?

Edit: I didn't smash the bottle, I pushed it off the counter and it broke. I didn't throw it.  
Edit2: alright, I get it. I'm going to get him $80 worth of stuff to make up for it. But I really don't appreciate being called violent or abusive. I've never hit him once, and I think that's a pretty rash assumption.

I've never before snuck alcohol into a venue and always been a believer in the best way to sneak alcohol in somewhere is by putting it in your blood stream. However, I'd like to maintain a medium/low drunk through the whole 3ish hours. For that, I'd like to sneak in a mini mickey. They serve beer, but they're like $10 each and I don't want to spend 100s of dollars.

I am by no means a knowledgeable reviewer for this kind of stuff so take my review with a grain of salt if you're done booze snob. 

First impressions came from pouring about an ounce into a jigger, and it was still rather warm (I was excited to try it). It was incredibly smooth, smelled neutral, but it had a good bit more flavor than I would have expected for something labeled as an unflavored vodka. It's made with rye, and that is very obvious on the first taste as it gives a hit of spice that's very apparent and the main flavor of the spirit. There were also some very mild citrus notes, and maybe a touch of vanilla, but the spice was really the foremost flavor. 

I'd say this would be great in a dirty martini, vesper, or a vodka aviation with some of the traditional ratios tweaked. 

My typical vodka is Tito's, this blows it out of the water for me, but is a good bit more expensive. Unless it's going into a spirit forward cocktail I don't think it would make sense to use this as a catch all for things like bloody's and citrus heavy cocktails/mixers. 

For reference my go to spirits are dry gins, aquavit,  and rye whiskey. I really appreciate a spirit forward cocktail, so if you are looking for alcohol that you can't taste, or often drink mixers that heavily mask the spirit I don't think I would recommend this for you.",t2_5jqdyulo,Tom of Finland vodka,t3_136i491,136i491,Nick240z,11,https://i.redd.it/297vx69janxa1.jpg,0.98,130,vodka,0.2541050910949707,0.0893189534544944,0.2172663509845733,0.0402173809707164,0.0325128175318241,0.1322685182094574,0.0285662598907947,0.018775850534439,0.0247786790132522,0.1621901243925094,0.9959765076637268,0.004023442044854164

My question is, what is the viability of trying to Jerry rig my car to run on vodka in a shtf scenario? 

For context: my current prepping plan and what I've been preparing for, is basically having enough stored in a large car to be able to set up a temporary ""glamping"" setup and have enough tools to build a better survival setup from scratch using resources in the environment, and if it goes on long enough and I have to go farther and farther to collect resources like wood or collecting mud on hillsides to make bricks it would be helpful if my car is still usable.

TIA for any responses, feel free to dog my sh*t so I don't go on a rabbit hole of f**king up my car for no reason.

3077,2023-04-19 14:32:56-05:00,1681932776.0,stopdrinking,t5_2s7yr,"Hello. Day 102 for me today.

On Monday January 2nd I gave up ""again"".  On Friday January 6th, 5 days later, I purchased a half bottle of vodka and drank it (secretly). On Saturday January 7th, I said ""no more"" - again! On Monday January 9th I went to my first AA meeting ever. I haven't drank since January 7th.

I stopped drinking a half to three quarter bottle of vodka every single day for about 5 years, with the prior 25 years being slightly less, but heavy daily drinking nonetheless.

Every day I woke up, I had pain in my hands, my feet, and my belly. I would dry heave and gag in the shower. I walked around like I was in a video game - detached from reality. For several years I swore I would give up daily, but by mid afternoon I would be shaking (my hands had started to permanently shake) and the cycle would continue. I was in mental anguish, hated myself for what I had become, and knew I would die because of my drinking, so considered suicide frequently to speed up the inevitable process.

I thought I was ""too good"" for AA and considered it/them (in my mind) as a bunch of losers - so ridiculous was my thinking, while I was meanwhile crying in my own misery in a house filled with hidden empty bottles - bottles I would search for and drain little dribbles from whenever my booze ran out.

I was a CEO, and the world saw me as an ""important person"" with a perfect life. NOPE. 

So, what happened? Well, I am sorry to say, I am not too sure really, but I will explain as best as I can.

1. It turned out they were not a bunch of losers. They were folks just like me who understood what I was going through and offered me support, on my terms (meaning not too pushy), so sitting in a room with them became enjoyable/cathartic/educational/normal/friendly.
2. Being agnostic, I decided to ""pray"" and meditate daily, even though I had no idea what I was praying to.
3. I rid myself of my preconceived notions of ""God"" and ""religion""  and settled on my own version - a universal energy. I stopped trying to personify the concept of ""God"" (I still have a little trouble with that word) and think of it more as the potential I was born with that I let run awry - my best self, if you like.
4. I did 90 in 90 (meetings in days) and have continued going to a daily meeting, sometimes via zoom.
5. I started to journal and write out thoughts, feelings, regrets and hopes, as often as possible.

Then, I slowly started noticing changes. 

1. I started to want to connect with people more  (vesus isolating)
2. I started to smile more at strangers, wanted to do more ""good"" in my days, and wanted to spend more effort on being mindful.
3. I started to begin noticing who I was and what I enjoyed doing, paying more attention to having fulfilling days. I started to like myself more.
4. My health, diet, sleeping and exercise all improved.
5. My confidence increased and my anxiety reduced.
6. I began thinking about my actions, and became WAY LESS reactive.

I am far from cured :). I still have thoughts of drinking. Usually out of boredom, sometimes, because I want to block out negatives, but rarely, if never, because of compulsion. It is easier now. I first resigned myself begrudgingly to never wanting to drink again, and now I just consider the positives to be too precious to throw it all away. I was afraid of NEVER drinking again - parties, friends, family, holidays, BBQ's, etc. Now, not so much!

Do I treat the ""Big Book"" like a bible? No. Do I subscribe to every single concept in AA? No. Do I believe AA has helped me? Yes.  
The point of this post is more to recommend AA to those who, like me, were completely skeptical. If you are suffering, which you probably are if you are here, I would suggest giving it a shot. I realized that examining myself, my faults, my resentments and my shortcomings, were/are part of my drinking, and understanding them better helps me to come at life on different terms.

Hope this is helpful.

Yesterday, while browsing the WH wiki during a particularly boring shift, I came up upon this page talking about KISLEVIAN VODKA and how highly sought after of a commodity it is outside of Kislev itself.

Quote:

-""Kislev Vodka (aka Kislevite Vodka or Kislevian Vodka) is a form of pure-grain alcohol hailing from said-northern realm. Often sold along the River Urskoy, it is popular in Ostland. (...)  Next to Bretonnian Brandy, Kislevian Vodka is a highly sought after commodity.""

I immediately thought of Dwarf Ale, and how the Dawi can produce it in their economic building, as well as the Elves with their trinkets, mirroring that, we could add Kislev Vodka as a tradable resource to, for exaple, the tavern building chain (the one that gives growth and public order).

I think that this addition would boost Kislev's economy enough to allow us to field varied armies by the mid-game and keep scaling upwards, while at the same time remaining lore-friendly and certainly not game breaking, since the same mechanic works for other races as well.

Let me know your opinions, I'm curious to know what you think about this idea.

Thanks.

Smirnoff also gets me very drunk, and once gave me a hangover so terrible I wanted to go to the hospital lol. Tito’s I’ve seen praised very highly here but it didn’t live up to the hype for me and made me throw up. Not sure if I just got a bad batch but it tasted kind of chemical-y to me. Had to give the rest of it to a friend because after that the smell of it was enough to make me want to puke again

I’d a really crappy day - got passed over for a promotion in favour of someone that everyone agrees does next to no work at all - so I told her that I wasn’t feeling up to coming for her leaving drinks (where I was planning to have a lemonade or two then call it a night anyway), I just wanted to go home. She said she totally understood, what had happened was really shitty, and told me to go home and chill. Then she put her hand in my jacket pocket, it was hanging on the back of my chair, and said ‘something for the journey home which might cheer you up’. I assumed it was another cookie or something and just laughed and thanked her.

Five minutes later, I’m outside heading home, I put my hand in my pocket and feel a glass bottle. I pull it out, and it’s a bottle of gin. 

I stared at it for a moment. Luckily there was a bin a few metres away. I threw it straight in and kept walking. And that was that.

For the first time in my adult life, I decided to deal with feelings of disappointment and rejection head on. Not drown my emotions with booze. It doesn’t feel good… but also it does. This is how it’s supposed to feel. Life is supposed to be full of ups and downs and pain and joy and rage and I want to feel all of it. No more running. 

I threw the poison in the bin, and yesterday marked 7 months sober for me. IWNDWYT!",t2_8xx7f5t5,I had an AWFUL day at work.

Gin is an unusual, from a historical perspective, in that additives are (in a way) traditional.

However, there are loads of gin today that are adding sugar - for various reasons. Now, as a classification, in Old Tom this is practically a prerequisite but what about “traditional”, or “contemporary” gins. Should there be a statement regarding the sugar added?

Some markets is much more transparent than others. For example in the US you can have sugar added with no clarification at all.

Ingredients:

-A big handful of basil leefs with the stems
-6cl/ 2oz of Gin (I used the botanist)
-3cl/ 1oz of Lemon juice
-2cl/ 3/4 of an ounce simple sirup

Recipe: 

Add your basil leefs to your shaker along with your gin and smash it until you expressed all of the basil oils.
Add in your lemon juice and the simple and give it a shake with ice. 
Double strain it over a tumbler filled with ice and garnish with a few basil leefs.

I would prefer it with a bit more lemon juice and a egg white for a nice foam but this recipe is good too.

So I experimented and started taking 3 shots ng gilbeys gin (red) 30 minutes before my (video) interview. Seryoso ako ha. Na-rerelax ako at hindi na kakabahan at napansin ko magaling ako mag english dire-diretso at kahit gaano kahirap yung tanung may sagot ako lagi. Ewan ko ba, it makes my mind active, i could think clearly, it boosts my confidence at lumalabas yung galing ko kasi kalmado ako. I dont consider myself as an alcoholic naman. Beer lang iniinom ko occasionally. Kung baga etong technique ko na ito pang ""special occasion"" lang - during job interviews or kung kailangan ko magsalita sa harap ng madami tao. 3 shots makes me relaxed, 4 shots makes me tipsy, 5 shots lasing na. So max 3 shots lang ako. The trick is to know my limit - wag dapat ako umabot dun sa tipsy part. Nakuha ko yung idea sa yun sa mga hollywood celebs kung saan magsa-shot muna sila ng preferred liquor nila bago sumalang sa mga talk shows. Anyone else who does this? I know its not good practice. Pero sabi nga nila, find your personal cure. Kayo, meron ba kayo tips and tricks?

EDIT: Thank you, I appreciate the concern. You are all so kind and sweet! However, the point of my post is not about alcoholism. If we can remove that narrative and think of it more like ""how the brain works"". Or at least how my brain works.

In a way for me after i saw his death the first thing that came to mind is that the only reason he didnt succed its because well hes not the main character so of course he will fail. I really think that his plan was perfect. His deceptive bankai was just what he needed for this situation, being able to even trick Aizen with not telling him everything about it and this way he got the poison in. Also he was able to learn how to remove the hypnosis  which no one knew how to do but all of this were for nothing because aizen just got up everything ok and was able to kill him.

I had the opportunity during this years’ Wine in Paris event to taste a Japanese Gin, in the international hall (one of the Japanese booth). It is brewed solely with cherry blossoms. Unfortunately, the papers and visit cards I took during this visit were thrown away, and now I can’t remember the name of the distillery or of the Gin itself. I would like to find the name in order to purchase it in my country (France). 
Does it ring a bell to any of you ? It’s a very strong (but sweet) gin with a distinctive and dominant flowery taste, and the bottle, of course, displays a blossoming cherry tree

EDIT: I forgot the obvious : it’s produced in Japan.

Number of Price Increases: 402
Number of Price Decreases: 230
Number of New Products: 27
Number of Status Changes: 15

There are too many changes to fit into a single post so I've had to split the post into two. This post has changes for American Whiskey, Brandy, Canadian Whiskey, Cordial, Gin, and Irish Whisky. Please see the [second post with Rum, Scotch, Tequila, and Vodka changes](https://www.reddit.com/r/OhioLiquor/comments/134lvqg/new_and_changed_products_may_2023_2_of_2_rum/) although comments will be locked on that post so that they're all in one place here.

I plan to reply to this post throughout the month if I notice other significant changes happening or at the end of the month before the next update to keep the changes in one place. Here's a link back to [what changed in April 2023](https://www.reddit.com/r/OhioLiquor/comments/128ldnx/new_and_changed_products_april_2023/).

For each category I've sorted by the amount of the price increase or decrease. New products are shown first, then price decreases are shown in decreasing order followed by price increases in increasing order. At the end are products with other changes unrelated to price.

Current product status is indicated on each line as follows. OHLQ hasn't publicly explained what these things mean but I've included my best guess below.

* A = Active
 * Regularly supplied and available for purchase
* D = De-Listed
 * No longer carried by OHLQ, may still be available in some stores or the warehouse. Sometimes considered a Last Call product
* I = Inactive
 * Discontinued by the supplier or otherwise unavailable to OHLQ
* S = Special Order
 * Regularly available but in limited supply. Not available in very many stores
* V = Value-Added-Pack
 * Bottle comes with some kind of extra gift like a glass/mug/etc

And one can experiment with different kinds of olives, stuff them with blue cheese or feta, pimento or bacon or jerky, I saw one bartender talking about the abomination of Tex Mex stuffed olives he was asked to create that ended up being a huge hit.

But has anyone here tried some more exotic alternatives, maybe even experimented with gin pairings for them?

How about okra, drunken tomatoes, pickled chilies or garlic? Moroccan preserved lemon? My family had an old friend years back that used to pickle northern pike and walleye with orange, lemon, garlic, and herbs. What about something like that?

Hello mixologists and liquor enthusiasts. Welcome to the monthly original cocktail competition.

For those looking to participate, here are the rules and guidelines. Any violations of these rules will result in disqualification from this month's competition.

1. You must use both of the listed ingredients, but you can use them in absolutely any way or form (e.g. a liqueur, infusion, syrup, ice, smoke, etc.) you want and in whatever quantities you want. You do not have to make ingredients from scratch. You may also use any other ingredients you want.

2. Your entry must be an original cocktail. Alterations of established cocktails are permitted within reason.

3. You are limited to one entry per account.

4. Your entry must include a **name** for your cocktail, a **photograph** of the cocktail, a **description** of the scent, flavors, and mouthfeel of the cocktail, and most importantly a list of **ingredients** with **measurements** and **directions** as needed for someone else to faithfully recreate your cocktail. You may optionally include other information such as ABV, sugar content, calories, a backstory, etc.

5. All recipes must have been invented after the announcement of the required ingredients.

---

**Please only make top-level comments if you are making an entry.** Doing otherwise would possibly result in flooding the comments section. To accommodate the need for a comments section unrelated to any specific entry, [**I have made a single top-level comment that you can reply to for general discussion.**](https://old.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/128aib6/original_cocktail_competition_april_2023_gin_egg/jehyp40/) You may, of course, reply to any existing comment.

---

How you upvote is entirely up to you. You are absolutely encouraged to recreate the shared drinks, but this may not always be possible or viable and so should not be considered as a requirement. You can vote based on the list of ingredients and how the drink is described, the photograph, or anything else you like.

#Do not downvote entries

Winners will be final at the end of the month at 23:59:59 EST and will be recorded with links to their entries in this post. You may continue voting after that, but the results will not change. There are 1st place, 2nd place, and 3rd place positions. 2nd place and 3rd place may receive ties, but in the event of a 1st place tie, I will act as a tie-breaker. I will otherwise withhold from voting. Should there be a tie for 2nd place, there will be no 3rd place.

RUM - Rumble is a massive disruptor in digital media, web hosting, and cloud services-- offering an alterative to YouTube and Amazon Web Services. Competing with Tik-Tok, Twitch, and Reels /shorts etc. you can get Rumble in your browser, phone, or TV app /roku.

So you, the media giants and talking heads, thought mass banning accounts in the most freedom loving country in the world was a good idea?

# So what the fuck does this mean

The thesis is simple. Most everyone was wrong about  Rumble's market share and thus its value.

Rumble has proven YoY growth exceeding other existing viral products like Tik-Tok, and now it has reached critical mass exceeding **80MAU (Monthly Active Users)** which means it's reached brand recognition phase and has massive momentum that should only continue i.e.

# It's a snowball rolling down a hill

Anyone who is already a content creator or elsewhere now must recognize the value on uploading their content to Rumble as they are currently paying out more in order to gain market share. (you can post to multiple services, obviously) People searching for content must also consider visiting Rumble to find what they are looking for as it's a place that may potentially contain what they are looking for.

This means the brand and its userbase has now reached a size where its own size is helping it grow.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*The snowball picks up speed and mass as it rolls down the hill picking up more snow.*

# But who gives a shit

If you're here on WSB you should be looking for something with a good risk to reward ratio, or in your case something with a fair to lot of risk but a fuck ton of reward. Obviously in your favor and not the dealer's

# Let's take a look at the fundamentals

RUM is trading for $9.33 a share or about $2.61B marketcap

They're holding about 337M in cash&amp;eq , Net Asset Value is about 340M

Revenue is up a lot, up 316% 2022 vs 2021, Last Quarterly report \~20M in Revenue, here's some boring ass trajectories

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/on7vnr5i9jua1.png?width=732&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a8ad2aa703bd408eb61427c8d338b8772a9685d8

&amp;#x200B;

Currently that would mean from the basic ass analyst's prospective the stock looks overvalued

(2.6B/340M) \~7.5x P/B (Price to book ratio)

20M a quarter at conservative growth call it 100M

(2.6B/100M ) \~26x P/S (Price to sales ratio)

# But fuck that shit

# They've got this all wrong

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d1l7i5cj9jua1.jpg?width=225&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ef5c439dce085510800901b46e35a683cd3d641e

Let's talk about the sector they're in

20M/Q , call it 80M for 4 quarters for 'instantaneous annualized' revenue

With 80MAU this is 1 ARPU (average revenue per user)

# Why is ARPU so low?

\[link removed\]

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Disney+** global ARPU was **$4.30** in Q1, Domestic was $6.32 (subscription)  
&gt;  
&gt;**ESPN+** ARPU was **$4.73** in Q1 (subscription and advertising)  
&gt;  
&gt;**Hulu** SVOD ARPU was **$12.77** in Q1 (subscription and advertising)  
&gt;  
&gt;**Netflix** global ARPU was **$14.91** in Q1 (subscription)  
&gt;  
&gt;**HBO Max** domestic ARPU was **$11.24** in A1 (subscription and advertising)  
&gt;  
&gt;**Paramount** domestic ARPU of “around **$9**” in Q1 (subscription and advertising)  
&gt;  
&gt;**Peacock TV** ARPU was “around **$10**”, in Q4 2021, no Q1 2022 number given (subscription and advertising)  
&gt;  
&gt;**Roku** ARPU was **$42.91** in Q1 (trailing 12 months), which is $3.57 a month (advertising)  
&gt;  
&gt;**fuboTV** “Advertising ARPU” was **$7.11** in Q1 (their long-term target for Ad ARPU is $15-$20)  
&gt;  
&gt;**Vizio** ARPU was **$23.68** in Q1 (trailing 12-months), which is $1.97 a month (advertising)  
&gt;  
&gt;**Starz** domestic ARPU was “around **$5.70 to $6**”, in May 2021 and Lions Gate hasn’t updated it since then (subscription)  
&gt;  
&gt;\*\*Discovery’\*\*s overall D2C ARPU was “**around $7**”, with Discovery+ ARPU of “more than **$10**”. These numbers are from July 2021 and Discovery hasn’t broken out ARPU since them. (subscription and advertising)

Current figures are pretty close to the above

The most similar product is YouTube had about $29B in revenue in 2021 and about 2.68B MAU this means **ARPU is $10-11**

It's reasonable to suggest Rumble's ARPU will change greatly from \~1 to at least 5-10

But why is ARPU \~$1 now?

It's simple, Rumble is paying out hugely to its users to incentive growth for the snowball effect

So earlier when it was stated (2.6B/100M ) \~26x P/S (Price to sales ratio), the market is really pricing in an ARPU of around 4 to give an actual future P/S of 6:1 which is more in line with these type of companies

&amp;#x200B;

Another more fundamental prospective to consider is Revenue Per Minutes of Engagement

YouTube Reportedly Does 1B a day , this is \~30.5B hrs watched/month

Rumble Does 11.1B Minutes a month, this is (/60) \~ 185M hrs watched/month

YouTube reports \~29.24B in annual revenue, this is about $2.44B /avg month revenue

Rumble reported 20M for 1 quarterly revenue, this is about  $6.67M /avg month revenue

Meaning:

YouTube's revenue is $2.44B/30B hrs **\~$0.08 /hr watched or $4.88 per minute**

Rumble's revenue is $6.67M/$185h hrs **\~ 0.036 /hr watched or $2.16 per minute**

**This 2.26x as much per minute of viewing** which is another multiple of at least 2 when monetization is made proper, the view time per user will go up as well once the platform is larger with more users and content.

# RUM is currently fairly/under priced given this adjustment

So really the relative metric looking forward should be **Marketcap Per User**

&amp;#x200B;

YouTube is worth 180B going off about a 6-7 P/S ratio \[link removed\]

Tik-Tok is valued at Around 70B

FB+Insta Reels is valued at (3B Rev \* 6.5 \~20B) \[link removed\]

The total value of this marketspace is currently at least 300 B

**This is 115x the current marketcap of RUM**

(in a growing market as well, that will be much bigger than 300B in the future)

&gt;The global video streaming market size was valued at **USD 372.07 billion in 2021** and is projected to grow from USD **473.39 billion in 2022** to USD **1,690.35 billion by 2029**, exhibiting a CAGR of 19.9% during the forecast period.

\[link removed\]

# But that's just Videos and Clips

&gt;The global web hosting services market size was **USD 75.03 billion in 2020** and is projected to grow from USD **83.99 billion in 2021** to USD **267.10 billion in 2028**, exhibiting a CAGR of 18.0% in the 2021-2028 period.

\[link removed\]

&gt;The global cloud computing market size was valued at **USD 405.65 billion in 2021** and is projected to grow from **USD 480.04 billion in 2022** to USD **1,712.44 billion by 2029**, exhibiting a CAGR of 19.9% during the forecast period.

\[link removed\]

The total marketspace for RUM's existing products is

About 500B expected to grow to about 3.5T by 2030

This is present **192x RUM's market cap** to **1340x RUM's Market cap in \~7 years**

# Here's some Price scenarios for you

Currently RUM is \~3% Video/Clips Market (going off 2800MAU vs 80M) and sub 1% on the other two despite having a few very large costumers and some other topics that will be mentioned soon

(2023) 0.03\*400B \~ 12B ------------------(**\~5x in share price w/ current market share**)--**(bear case)**

(2030) 0.03\*1800B + 0.001\*300B  + 0.001\*1825B \~ 56B marketcap (\~21.5x in share price)

&amp;#x200B;

*Roughly doubling current market share while adding minimal other products* ***(neutral case)***

RUM 6% Video Market + 1% Webhosting+ 1% Cloud services

(2023) 0.06\*400B + 0.01\*85B  + 0.01\*500B \~ 30B marketcap (**\~12x in share price)**

(2030) 0.06\*1800B + 0.01\*300B  + 0.01\*1825B \~ 129B marketcap **(\~50x in share price)**

&amp;#x200B;

*Roughly quadrupling current market share while adding minimal other products* ***(Bull case)***

RUM 12% Video Market + 2% Webhosting+ 2% Cloud services

(2023) 0.12\*400B + 0.02\*85B  + 0.02\*500B \~ 30B marketcap (**\~24x in share price)**

(2030) 0.12\*1800B + 0.02\*300B  + 0.02\*1825B \~ 129B marketcap **(\~100x in share price)**

&amp;#x200B;

**Moderately Strong Bull case**

RUM 40% Video Market + 5% Webhosting+ 5% Cloud services

(2023) 0.40\*400B + 0.05\*85B  + 0.05\*500B \~ 189B marketcap (**\~73x in share price)**

(2030) 0.40\*1800B + 0.05\*300B  + 0.05\*1825B \~ 826B marketcap **(\~316x in share price)**

Probably a bit later than 2023 for these numbers

&amp;#x200B;

Short term

Bear case for 2023-2025: is $50/share - **Bull case is $223 a share (24 bagger)**

Long Term

Bear case for 2028-2030: is $200/share - **Bull case is $940 a share (100 bagger)**

&amp;#x200B;

In my humblest of opinions

# Why Rumble

So how's Rumble going to get from 3% to roughly 10-15% marketshare ? Other than the thesis above which talks about the **Snowball...**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Well my good regard, have you met this man yet?

Rumble is already peering with **Starlink** (Musk's world wide satellites providing Rumble with unstoppable infrastructure) and partnering with Trump Media. All has happened already publicly and officially.

# When Moon

Yes we all want to buy calls because RUM stock going back to NAV losing you about $8 of the $9 a share or going to $1000 a share in the next 2 years isn't enough risk symmetry already, let's try to time this shit like a good regard with call options. No one knows but here's some decent guesses for when the next legs up are

# TL;DR

&amp;#x200B;

# Positions

**Shares** of RUM for DRS since Regsho needs to be enforced

**Warrants**  Ticker: RUMBW (valued at 2.09 per warrant these give you the right to buy RUM on or before 16th of Sept 2027 11.50 per share. (the 2.09 doesn't come back, so add that to your cost basis on top of the 11.50)

So it's basically a **11.50c 9/16/27** priced at 2.09 .. this is a lot better than regular calls in most situations

I'll probably pick up some way OTM weeklies, monthlies and LEAPs for you Degens as well

&gt;YouTube fired it's CEO of 9 years Susan Wojcicki on February 16th for a reason.  
&gt;  
&gt;Constant devaluation and arbitrary suspension of thousands of content creators left the platform in 2023 a corporate approved soulless and barren wasteland of unoriginal content.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is a huge problem. YouTube acted like the arbitor of all things acceptable. Content creators cannot risk the thousands of hours of work and investment just to have their labors demonitize (and not given a rational explanation as to why it occured).  
&gt;  
&gt;Profits got hammered and the problem is not going away because it systemic. YouTube is now an advertisement platform to preview what's going to be on.... Rumble.  
&gt;  
&gt;YouTube has lost it niche. It's now a shadow of its former self. It has branded itself as an psychotic roomate. Who will throw your clothes onto your front yard (and change the locks on your doors) for no reason.  
&gt;  
&gt;RUM looks tasty.

Original post:

&amp;#x200B;

Greetings from Germany,

I wanted to ask for some recommendations for liquors that are cheap but still decent quality for the price. Of course there already are plenty of recommendations online, but unfortunately, most of them recommend the same few brands, some of which are not available in german supermarkets OR are much more expensive here than in the States for example.

I already bought some spirits based on those lists, that are available here.

For example (and feel free to share your opinions, alternatives and correct me, if you think that I'm wrong), in terms of gin I've read that Gordon's is supposed to be decent for its price, for white rum I have Bacardi's Carta Blanca Superior and Havana Club 3 Anos, for Scotch I have Famous Grouse, and finding decent Vodka is no problem at all.

Dark rum and US whiskey on the other hand are more of a problem. For example, I've read that Plantation, Rittenhouse and Old Overholt are supposed to be good. But I couldn't find them in any store.

Now obviously, many of you won't know what brands are available in Germany, but it would be immensely helpful to have some recommendations that usually aren't on those top 10 budget liquors lists you can find online.

I would greatly apprecate your help, thanks for reading!",t2_635uw02fm,Budget liquors that are still decent?

I'm building up my bar to cover the classics. I'm not really interested in tiki drinks at the moment. The more I learn about rum, the more i am shocked to discover just how much variation there is within the category. I'm sure I'll get around to exploring the depths of this spirit in time, but for space and budgetary reasons, I'd like to start with just one bottle that can cover as many of the classic recipes as possible. 

Some options I've seen recommended over and over again are Plantation 3 Stars, Don Q Gold, and Flor de Cana 4 Year Extra Seco. I don't really want to spend more than $25-$30, but I might be willing if there's something out there that's truly universal. What say you, cocktailing friends?

A side question: what's the feeling about rums that have had sugar added post-distillation? I feel like that would be sacrilege with other spirits, but I guess in this case, you're just adding more of a thing to itself.

Für meine Masterarbeit in Linguistik habe ich genau 4 Monate Zeit und meine Frist endet Anfang Juli. Durch einen unvorhergesehenen operativen Eingriff und ein Beinahe-Todesfall im der Familie war ich im ersten Monat mental zu abgelenkt und gestresst, als dass ich mich wirklich hätte konzentrieren können. Jetzt ist schon der zweite Monat fast rum und ich stehe gefühlt vor nichts. Die Texte, die ich lesen soll, bleiben nicht im Gedächtnis und meine Betreuerin wirft mir immer mehr Fragen auf, sodass ich langsam an dem Thema und vor allem auch mir zweifle. Die Studierenden Beratung der Uni hat trotz meiner beharrlichen Anrufe keine Termine in den nächsten 6-8 Wochen und auch die psychologische Ambulanz der Uni hat erstmal keine Zeit. Ich weiß nicht mehr genau, wie ich es noch schaffen kann. 
(Thema ist die negative Konnotation des deutschen Akzent im Englischen unter Deutsch Muttersprachlern und wie das in der Interaktion verhandelt wird) 

Anforderung sind mind. 60 Seiten sowie eine 20-minütige Präsentation in den nächsten Wochen. 

Ist es noch realistisch das zu schaffen? Habt ihr Tipps und Tricks, die Motivationslosigkeit zu bekämpfen? Falls ihr Literatur oder inhaltliche Tipps habt, dann gerne raus damit, ich bin kurz vorm Breakdown.

Summary - woman resurrected an 80s chocolate bar that went out of production in the 90s. After the initial success due to nostalgia, they put in a huge order thinking they have hit the jackpot. Due to supply chain issues, the goods came late but came all at once. People also stopped buying them in large quantity after the nostalgia wore off. Now they need to get rid of 133,000 chocolate bars before it all expires in June.

When I tried to sip it, I had a half-inch of...some sort of transparent but gelatinous goop; like raw egg whites, but of course alcoholic and almost stringy, and it came out as a connected glop almost. 

Once I swallowed that, the goop was largely gone but the liquid (neither ""brine"" nor ""juice"" seems accurate) looks like it's got transparent stuff in it.

The remaining pickles seem a bit more shriveled and small, but other than that taste fine.

I wouldn't say this is super tasty, but maybe the principle can be used to do something that is, so I'd like to know what happened and can't figure out what to research.

Ingredients:

Mt. Olive, no sugar added sweet gherkins.    
Pickle ingredients:  Cucumbers, water, vinegar, salt, calcium chloride (firming agent), sodium benzoate (preservative), alum, sucralose, natural flavors, xanthan gum, polysorbate 80, and yellow 5.

And, of course, overproof rum.  (Wray and Nephew, 63% abv.)

BALCONES RUMBLE CASK RESERVE SINGLE BARREL
67.8% (135.6 PROOF) ||COST: $67.99
73 months in French Oak Barrels

***Neat in a Glencairn glass, air time 20 minutes

NOSE
Immediately pick up on those sweet rum notes, must be part of the turbinado sugar base. Honey and vanilla wafers, dried Apricot, fresh cooked figs prepped for jam, sugar cookie. Bit of ethanol heat of the glass is agitated but dissipates quickly for the proof. 


PALATE
On to the good stuff. This is definitely candy in a glass. Big time honey upfront that gives way into a cirtusy note almost like, orange marmalade or Starburst, waves of Apricot and peach. Slowly tapers into a light spice, not quite cinnamon, but similar to toned down red hots and light cherry

FINISH
Lingering Kentucky hug to let you know it's a proofer, but not overpowering at all. I've had lesser proofs that burn more. The most promonent lingering flavor is the honey which is present throughout, and starting to get more of the fig and dark fruit on the end. Ends on a sweet high note like dessert. Medium to long finish as expected with a honey base which tends to be thick. 


OVERALL RATING: 8
I had no idea what to expect going into this. I've only had 1 or 2 Balcones products before this, and grabbed this on a whim because it sounded unique and interesting, and I'm a sucker for higher proofs. This definitely drinks closer to the rum side than a bourbon due to being made with turbinado sugar, but I do pick up on some of the familiar bourbon notes of vanilla, sugar cookie, citrus, and some light oak. I definitely think this punches above it's weight class and definitely has me on the lookout for more Balcones products. 

Is it worth the $68 I paid for it? Obviously subjective but I'd do it again in a heartbeat. It's different than your every day drinker and since I've been exploring more rums I can appreciate what this pour offers. It's almost like a fusion of the two but your mileage may very. Perhaps I stumbled onto a great pick.",t2_6bgqu,Review #10 - Balcones Rumble Cask Reserve Single Barrel (TW SP) - Rum disguised as bourbon?,t3_134bsvi,134bsvi,L1meRa1n,25,https://i.redd.it/h3eq2484o6xa1.jpg,0.93,50,rum,0.6918625235557556,0.0069994772784411,0.1253468841314315,0.0654301047325134,0.0146071212366223,0.030608782544732,0.0284936521202325,0.0137819033116102,0.0168418567627668,0.0060276519507169,0.9963440299034119,0.003656022949144244

. 


Aged a total of 67 months 
(finished in new American oak, then finished in used American oak that previously held Balcones Rum) 
. 


***Neat in a glencarin for 15 mins 
. 


NOSE: 

Not as much ethanol as you'd think for the proof, rather faint. Very citrus forward. I'm getting tons of stonefruit. Peaches, orange zest, vanilla frosting. Very faint tabacco/leather. Such a sweet nose you'd think this was a dessert wine


PALATE: 

Follows the nose in the fact that this thing is just straight candied stonefruit. Sugar coated orange peels, stewed peaches, honeysuckle. Not sure what it is with these Balcones Single malts but they heavily lean on the fruit profile Imo. And in a good way. Also, for 66.6% this does not drink it's proof
I'm sipping this neat and it's candy. The rum characteristics definitely shine, but do not steal the show. If an orange Creamsicle was a bevarage this is it. Medium to thick viscosity. Costs the tongue in a buttery stonefruit marmalade 


FINISH:

This finish lasts for about 30 seconds. Sweet and savory. Finally getting some of the oak near the tail end of the finish. Vanilla and peach pie with a honey drizzle. 


OVERALL RATING:

 8.5

To be honest I was hesitant about dropping the $75 on this, but after my 10th review on the Balcones Rumble, I figured I'd take the risk since rumble was such a fantastic and unique pour. Still a tough pill to swallow but I am glad I took it. 

Your mileage may vary, but this is one of the most stonefruit forward whiskys I've ever tried. It's not super complex but I didn't expect as much for it only being 5.6yrs of age (67 months) 

However, young age aside, this thing is packed full of flavor, has great viscosity, and to me is worth the price of entry. It's not your typical pour, more on the dessert side, but God damn it does it well. 

This is my 3rd offering from Balcones (true blue cask strength, and rumble being the other two) and now I'm on the hunt for the Cask strength Rye due to positive feedback on Rumbles review. 

If you're daring, I'd say this will be worth your time. Almost reminds me of the unique profile of those Barrell blends where it's a refreshing change of pace, but about $10-20 cheaper.",t2_6bgqu,Review #12 - Balcones: Texas Single Malt Single Barrel (Total Wine SP finished in Rum) - Orange Creamsicle Delight,t3_13b2640,13b2640,L1meRa1n,12,https://i.imgur.com/oBaxPzx.jpg,0.92,46,rum,0.356047123670578,0.121157594025135,0.1073298528790474,0.1614684015512466,0.028119945898652,0.0647333040833473,0.075198084115982,0.0271219387650489,0.0340133756399154,0.0248105004429817,0.9952155351638794,0.00478444853797555

I’ve been into tiki for about 2 years now, and now that I have a basic understanding of tiki fundamentals I’m ready to expand. 

The problem is I can never find the rums I need. I have been to several liquor stores all over Chicago, from red star in Logan to the binnys in Lincoln Park and can never seem to find staples like Clement VSOP or any appleton rums other than their youngins’

So, Chicago tiki friends, where are you sourcing your rums from locally in Chicago? 

I live in Logan Square, so if you know any good locales somewhere in the city proper- I’d love to hear um.

I would relish some rollicking rum recommendations in the 40-120EUR remunerative range for someone who hasn't had a rum since Captain Morgan in university. I love and am getting more into single malts, and Ralfy (my single malt mate guru) has suggested some rums (J Bally 2002, Foursquare 13, Hampden 8, Applesomething Estate off the top of my head), but I don't really know where to start.

For reference, I prefer more natural foods/drinks, without lots of GMO/pesticide-laden sugarcane or additives (I don't know if E150A is a thing in rum too, but I avoid it in my scotch). My favourite whiskies are bottled at 46% or above, and are natural colour and non-chill filtered: Ancnoc 18, Redbreast 12CS, and Ledaig 10.

Something tropical and fruity but complex and not too sweet, please. Would really appreciate some direction, cheers rum ragamuffins!

So I saw this on CBC this morning and stopped there with news for the morning. It was just such a sweet and strange story, so pure, so wholesome, it was all I needed to start my day with a smile

Anyways, one of the commenters there had suggested sending the bulk to Ukrainian front lines, a gift from Canada to soldiers who are dealing with a lot of hardship and stress. I know the lady is ready to eat the cost of the production, but is trying not to spend any more money to give them away. I also know this subreddit has represented the real spirit of Alberta for me, one that is kind, and generous and there for each other through hard times, which has been difficult to see over the last few years between the pandemic stress and the extreme polarisation happening in politics.

 So long story short, I had the idea to start a Go-Fund-Me to community-source the cost of shipping these bars overseas to some soldiers in need of a pick-me-up. I'm willing to do the leg work of connecting with Crystal, costing out the shipment and relevant organisations, etc. I just wanted to test the waters here and see if you Edmonton Redditors would be interested in pitching in a few dollars to cover the shipping costs.

3604,2023-04-27 04:48:00-05:00,1682588880.0,Ratschlag,t5_4cv0iv,"Moin!

Ich mach's kurz: meine Familie und Schulfreunde wohnen etwa 170km entfernt in der Heimat. Außerdem hab ich auch weiter verteilt noch ein paar Leute, die ich gerne für 1-2 Tage besuche(n möchte). In meiner Heimatstadt wohnen zB meine Großeltern etwas außerhalb, weshalb man dort auch nicht so einfach ohne Auto hin kommt.

Mit den öffis bin ich in ca 3h in der Heimat. Klar, bezahle ich dafür recht wenig aber für 1-2 Tage ist mir das manchmal zu lange und unsicher. Gerade letztes Wochenende musste ich spontan aufs Auto umsteigen, da ein schwerer Unfall passierte und sich alles nach hinten verschob oder ausfiel. 

Mit dem Auto brauche ich knapp 1,5h von Tür zu Tür, das kostet dann aber auch Mal eben 50-80€ Sprit und ist natürlich ökologisch eher schlecht, nur um mich und ein paar Klamotten zu tragen. 

Jetzt war meine Idee, dass das mit einem Motorrad alles viel entspannter wäre. Ich hätte die Möglichkeit, ein bisschen mehr auf dem ""Gepäckträger"" zu transportieren, ggf Satteltaschen sind eine Option oder einfach einen Rucksack. Ich bräuchte keine großen Parkplätze suchen.  
Klar, wäre das wieder eine Anschaffung, die dauerhaft finanziert werden muss, das Motorrad, die Schutzkleidung, Versicherung etc und erstmal der Führerschein selber. 

Dann ist da natürlich noch das extreme Verletzungsrisiko. Auf dem Zweirad lebt man im Straßenverkehr gefährlich, egal wie gut und erfahren man ist, die Dummheit mancher (Autofahrer) ist grenzenlos. Dennoch würde ich mich als umsichtiger und defensiver Fahrer bezeichnen. Konzentration ist eigentlich auch kein Problem und ich neige nicht dazu, mich zu überschätzen. Ich bin 24 Jahre alt.

Was meint ihr? Sollte ich mich Mal um Fahrschule bemühen oder ist das ein unnötig großer Aufwand (zeitlich, finanziell, und lagerungstechnisch), der kaum Mehrwert hat?

\---------------

Voices rose and fell in the house next door, and the mournful buzz of an accordion came from a bar down the street.

I paused. Like most others, I was a seeker, a mover, a malcontent, and at times a stupid hell-raiser. I was never idle long enough to do much thinking, but deep inside... I felt somehow that some of us (the lucky  ones) were making real progress, that we had taken an honest road, and that the best of us would inevitably make it over the top.

At the same time, I shared a dark suspicion that the life we were leading was a lost cause, and that we were all actors, kidding ourselves along on a senseless odyssey.

And it was **the tension between these two poles** \- a restless idealism on one hand and a sense of impending doom on the other - **that kept me going**.

Somehow.

\--------

It was the sounds of life and movement...  
Of people getting ready and people giving up,  
the sound of hope and the sound of hanging on,  
and behind them all,the quiet,

Added pectic enzyme to break down the fruit further and tossed in a couple of camden tablets to remove any wild yeast from the pineapple skins.

SG is 1.090 right after mixing it all together, which is the highest I have ever tried. I almost expect the pectic enzyme to help release a little more sugar from the whole fruit in the wash. My plan is to use EC-1118 to start followed by some DADY after 24 hours of work by the camden tablets.

I am afraid that the SG is too high. Does anyone else here have experience with a rum wash with a similar starting point?

# So what does this mean

The thesis is simple. Most everyone was wrong about  Rumble's market share and thus its value.

Rumble has proven YoY growth exceeding other existing viral products like Tik-Tok, and now it has reached critical mass exceeding **80MAU (Monthly Active Users)** which means it's reached brand recognition phase and has massive momentum that should only continue i.e.

# It's a snowball rolling down a hill

Anyone who is already a content creator or elsewhere now must recognize the value on uploading their content to Rumble as they are currently paying out more in order to gain market share. (you can post to multiple services, obviously) People searching for content must also consider visiting Rumble to find what they are looking for as it's a place that may potentially contain what they are looking for.

This means the brand and its userbase has now reached a size where its own size is helping it grow.

20M a quarter at conservative growth call it 100M

(2.6B/100M ) \~26x P/S (Price to sales ratio)

# But fuck that shit

# They've got this all wrong

Let's talk about the sector they're in

20M/Q , call it 80M for 4 quarters for 'instantaneous annualized' revenue

With 80MAU this is 1 ARPU (average revenue per user)

# Why is ARPU so low?

\[link removed\]

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Disney+** global ARPU was **$4.30** in Q1, Domestic was $6.32 (subscription)  
&gt;  
&gt;**ESPN+** ARPU was **$4.73** in Q1 (subscription and advertising)  
&gt;  
&gt;**Hulu** SVOD ARPU was **$12.77** in Q1 (subscription and advertising)  
&gt;  
&gt;**Netflix** global ARPU was **$14.91** in Q1 (subscription)  
&gt;  
&gt;**HBO Max** domestic ARPU was **$11.24** in A1 (subscription and advertising)  
&gt;  
&gt;**Paramount** domestic ARPU of “around **$9**” in Q1 (subscription and advertising)  
&gt;  
&gt;**Peacock TV** ARPU was “around **$10**”, in Q4 2021, no Q1 2022 number given (subscription and advertising)  
&gt;  
&gt;**Roku** ARPU was **$42.91** in Q1 (trailing 12 months), which is $3.57 a month (advertising)  
&gt;  
&gt;**fuboTV** “Advertising ARPU” was **$7.11** in Q1 (their long-term target for Ad ARPU is $15-$20)  
&gt;  
&gt;**Vizio** ARPU was **$23.68** in Q1 (trailing 12-months), which is $1.97 a month (advertising)  
&gt;  
&gt;**Starz** domestic ARPU was “around **$5.70 to $6**”, in May 2021 and Lions Gate hasn’t updated it since then (subscription)  
&gt;  
&gt;\*\*Discovery’\*\*s overall D2C ARPU was “**around $7**”, with Discovery+ ARPU of “more than **$10**”. These numbers are from July 2021 and Discovery hasn’t broken out ARPU since them. (subscription and advertising)

Current figures are pretty close to the above

The most similar product is YouTube had about $29B in revenue in 2021 and about 2.68B MAU this means **ARPU is $10-11**

It's reasonable to suggest Rumble's ARPU will change greatly from \~1 to at least 5-10

But why is ARPU \~$1 now?

It's simple, Rumble is paying out hugely to its users to incentive growth for the snowball effect

So earlier when it was stated (2.6B/100M ) \~26x P/S (Price to sales ratio), the market is really pricing in an ARPU of around 4 to give an actual future P/S of 6:1 which is more in line with these type of companies

&amp;#x200B;

Another more fundamental prospective to consider is Revenue Per Minutes of Engagement

YouTube Reportedly Does 1B a day , this is \~30.5B hrs watched/month

Rumble Does 11.1B Minutes a month, this is (/60) \~ 185M hrs watched/month

YouTube reports \~29.24B in annual revenue, this is about $2.44B /avg month revenue

Rumble reported 20M for 1 quarterly revenue, this is about  $6.67M /avg month revenue

Meaning:

YouTube's revenue is $2.44B/30B hrs **\~$0.08 /hr watched or $4.88 per minute**

Rumble's revenue is $6.67M/$185h hrs **\~ 0.036 /hr watched or $2.16 per minute**

**This 2.26x as much per minute of viewing** which is another multiple of at least 2 when monetization is made proper, the view time per user will go up as well once the platform is larger with more users and content.

# RUM is currently fairly/under priced given this adjustment

So really the relative metric looking forward should be **Marketcap Per User**

&amp;#x200B;

YouTube is worth 180B going off about a 6-7 P/S ratio \[link removed\]

Tik-Tok is valued at Around 70B

FB+Insta Reels is valued at (3B Rev \* 6.5 \~20B) \[link removed\]

The total value of this marketspace is currently at least 300 B

**This is 115x the current marketcap of RUM**

(in a growing market as well, that will be much bigger than 300B in the future)

&gt;The global video streaming market size was valued at **USD 372.07 billion in 2021** and is projected to grow from USD **473.39 billion in 2022** to USD **1,690.35 billion by 2029**, exhibiting a CAGR of 19.9% during the forecast period.

\[link removed\]

# But that's just Videos and Clips

&gt;The global web hosting services market size was **USD 75.03 billion in 2020** and is projected to grow from USD **83.99 billion in 2021** to USD **267.10 billion in 2028**, exhibiting a CAGR of 18.0% in the 2021-2028 period.

\[link removed\]

&gt;The global cloud computing market size was valued at **USD 405.65 billion in 2021** and is projected to grow from **USD 480.04 billion in 2022** to USD **1,712.44 billion by 2029**, exhibiting a CAGR of 19.9% during the forecast period.

\[link removed\]

The total marketspace for RUM's existing products is

About 500B expected to grow to about 3.5T by 2030

This is present **192x RUM's market cap** to **1340x RUM's Market cap in \~7 years**

# Here's some Price scenarios for you

Currently RUM is \~3% Video/Clips Market (going off 2800MAU vs 80M) and sub 1% on the other two despite having a few very large costumers and some other topics that will be mentioned soon

(2023) 0.03\*400B \~ 12B ------------------(**\~5x in share price w/ current market share**)--**(bear case)**

(2030) 0.03\*1800B + 0.001\*300B  + 0.001\*1825B \~ 56B marketcap (\~21.5x in share price)

&amp;#x200B;

*Roughly doubling current market share while adding minimal other products* ***(neutral case)***

RUM 6% Video Market + 1% Webhosting+ 1% Cloud services

(2023) 0.06\*400B + 0.01\*85B  + 0.01\*500B \~ 30B marketcap (**\~12x in share price)**

(2030) 0.06\*1800B + 0.01\*300B  + 0.01\*1825B \~ 129B marketcap **(\~50x in share price)**

&amp;#x200B;

*Roughly quadrupling current market share while adding minimal other products* ***(Bull case)***

RUM 12% Video Market + 2% Webhosting+ 2% Cloud services

(2023) 0.12\*400B + 0.02\*85B  + 0.02\*500B \~ 30B marketcap (**\~24x in share price)**

(2030) 0.12\*1800B + 0.02\*300B  + 0.02\*1825B \~ 129B marketcap **(\~100x in share price)**

&amp;#x200B;

**Moderately Strong Bull case**

RUM 40% Video Market + 5% Webhosting+ 5% Cloud services

(2023) 0.40\*400B + 0.05\*85B  + 0.05\*500B \~ 189B marketcap (**\~73x in share price)**

(2030) 0.40\*1800B + 0.05\*300B  + 0.05\*1825B \~ 826B marketcap **(\~316x in share price)**

Probably a bit later than 2023 for these numbers

&amp;#x200B;

Short term

Bear case for 2023-2025: is $50/share - **Bull case is $223 a share (24 bagger)**

Long Term

Bear case for 2028-2030: is $200/share - **Bull case is $940 a share (100 bagger)**

&amp;#x200B;

In my humblest of opinions

# Why Rumble

So how's Rumble going to get from 3% to roughly 10-15% marketshare ? Other than the thesis above which talks about the **Snowball...**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i6bfbhzfdnva1.jpg?width=1400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=227cc2d30f8880e71969f7ba3b7b18e96f30f0fc

&amp;#x200B;

Rumble is already peering with **Starlink** (Musk's world wide satellites providing Rumble with unstoppable infrastructure) and partnering with Trump Media. All has happened already publicly and officially.

# When Moon

Yes we all want to buy calls because RUM stock going back to NAV losing you about $8 of the $9 a share or going to $1000 a share in the next 2 years isn't enough risk symmetry already, let's try to time this shit like a good regard with call options. No one knows but here's some decent guesses for when the next legs up are

# Short Interest

Yeah some smooth brains are short this thing with 2.5-6 Days To Cover Ratio

5.7M shares , 9% of float \~62M, \~280M shares outstanding

Possible short and gamma-squeeze in the making there

Major investors include David Sacks and Peter Thiel (Pay Pal Mafia) bunch of other names. 75% retail, 20$ insider, 4% institutional.

# TL;DR

&amp;#x200B;

# Positions

**Shares** of RUM for DRS since Regsho needs to be enforced

**Warrants**  Ticker: RUMBW (valued at 2.09 per warrant these give you the right to buy RUM on or before 16th of Sept 2027 11.50 per share. (the 2.09 doesn't come back, so add that to your cost basis on top of the 11.50)

So it's basically a **11.50c 9/16/27** priced at 2.09 .. this is a lot better than regular calls in most situations

I'll probably pick up some way OTM weeklies, monthlies and LEAPs for you Degens as well

&gt;YouTube fired it's CEO of 9 years Susan Wojcicki on February 16th for a reason.  
&gt;  
&gt;Constant devaluation and arbitrary suspension of thousands of content creators left the platform in 2023 a corporate approved soulless and barren wasteland of unoriginal content.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is a huge problem. YouTube acted like the arbitor of all things acceptable. Content creators cannot risk the thousands of hours of work and investment just to have their labors demonitize (and not given a rational explanation as to why it occured).  
&gt;  
&gt;Profits got hammered and the problem is not going away because it systemic. YouTube is now an advertisement platform to preview what's going to be on.... Rumble.  
&gt;  
&gt;YouTube has lost it niche. It's now a shadow of its former self. It has branded itself as an psychotic roomate. Who will throw your clothes onto your front yard (and change the locks on your doors) for no reason.  
&gt;  
&gt;RUM looks tasty.

It has a very unique flavor and distinctive profile, often described as smelling like warm or carmalized bananas (it is excellent) the flavor is very unique and tough to describe, so I'm very much hoping some of you here have had it before.

Assuming some have, have you found any rums or other liquors which taste similar to it?  The reason I ask is I made a cocktail which included it and I love it a lot.  But I've been unable to find Grogue in America and given how difficult it is to get it out of Cape Verde, I'm hoping to make a substitute version with ingredients available in America.

They also tend to not be sipping rums, so they pretty much need to be used in cocktails. Below are some examples:

- El Dorado 3yr - When I need a light rum for something like a mojito, I grab the Havana Club 3yr first.

- El Dorado 8yr - I tend to grab the Hamilton 86 over this one.

- Mount Gay Eclipse - If a recipe calls for a lightly aged blended rum, I normally go for Appleton Signature

- Appleton Reserve - This one has been opened for 3yr and I still have half the bottle. With the 12yr and the Signature, I don't seem to use this one much at all.

- Goslings - I just don't make a lot of cocktails that call for a black rum (Hurricane and Jungle Bird). And If I do make one, I use Coruba instead.

- Barbancourt 5 star - I think there is one cocktail that I've made that uses this rum (Port au Prince)

- Wray &amp; Nephew - If I need to make a drink extra funky, I seem to grab Rum Fire over this one

- Plantation Xaymaca - I go for Appleton Signature and 12yr

- Hamilton Zombie Blend - I have made Zombies and Jet Pilots with this and they never taste as good compared to when I use a blend of other rums.

- Various Agricole blancs - I went to Guadeloupe and Martinique and splurged on over a dozen 55% and higher rhum blancs. These don't have a lot of tiki use and I don't seem to be very often in the mood for a ti punch. Moving forward I will keep only 2-3 varieties of these in stock at a time. Some are decent sippers by themselves but others are not.

- Leblon Cachaca - Besides a caiprihina or a daiquiri, I don't use this one too much. And apparently there are much better bottles to buy but they aren't easy to find in my area.

- Pussers - The only time I use this is with a Painkiller and I almost never make that cocktail because it's so heavy.

Edit: responding here, thanks for the responses. Glad I'm not over reacting on this.

The Clase Azul bottle has been seen and showcased on so many shows, not unlike Fireball was a few years back. (Other examples include Jonathan Adler being featured on RHOBH, HomeGoods on RHONY, etc.) 

So I wasn’t surprised that this bottle was featured, but then they literally resorted to printing out a huge image of the bottle to keep on display (on display on display) during the last episode. I also noticed that Porsha clarified in her confessional that Gizelle handled the printing—and made *sure* to clearly say *Clase Azul*.

Does anyone else feel like the product features just totally jumped the shark on this season of UGT? I admit that I’m a grumpy old lady when my gas pump starts advertising products to me, so maybe I’m just extra sensitive…

But I feel like we could have had more interesting conversations if Producing Ass Gizelle didn’t help move this advertisement throughout the entire week.

ETA: a commenter pointed out that Gizelle lied from the start about the tequila when she said she *only* drinks tequila, and *only* drinks Clase Azul. We have seen her drink champagne, whiskey, and Fireball on RHOP. “I only drink Clase Azul” is the most basic ad copy there is.",t2_8b0im62i5,Did we really just watch multiple weeks of advertising for tequila?,t3_12wgr17,12wgr17,B1tchMcConnell,86,https://www.reddit.com/r/BravoRealHousewives/comments/12wgr17/did_we_really_just_watch_multiple_weeks_of/,0.97,332,tequila,0.8538510799407959,0.0015456782421097,0.0441576540470123,0.0098684607073664,0.0139872198924422,0.0142091736197471,0.0103173730894923,0.0028719527181237,0.0067016473039984,0.0424898006021976,0.9949856400489807,0.005014326889067888

Costco’s long had their huge bottle of silver tequila, which is good for margaritas and not much else but is $18 for 1.75L, so for that, I’ll be okay with it. In 2021/2022, they added the “Costcomigos,” their Añejo Casamigos knockoff, which I’ve enjoyed for the price ($30 for 1L). I’m admittedly much more of a rum guy than tequila, but I noticed yesterday that they seem to have totally reworked their tequila lineup and introduced these two new bottles. Costco is usually not very transparent with their labeling and distilling, so I’m especially shocked at all the information on the Blanco - has anybody tried these? Any thoughts?

The new Blanco was, at my Costco (NJ) $28 for 1.75L, while the Reposado was $20 for 1L.

Was actually considering picking up a single high end tequila, but I feared that my Don Julio 1942 expectations were too high and that I'd walk away disappointed. So I decided to put my eggs in multiple baskets.

I love cocktails and am starting to try sipping spirits (with a splash of rich demerara syrup), so I chose four spirits in the $30-$40 range that all had 90+ ratings.

Everyone always talks about the Fortalezas, Ochos, El Tesoros, Cascahuins, Fuentesecas, ArteNOMs, etc. Of the world… but what is everyone’s favorite under the radar brand?

A couple that top the list for me:

1) Siembra Valles &amp; Azul:  

This is borderline because I feel like these brands are always spoken highly of when I see them mentioned, but due to lack of availability, I don’t see them talked about that much.  IMO, David Suro’s complementary Highlands and Lowlands brands are as good as anything out there.  Simply amazing tequila.

2. Gran Dovejo:

Another from NOM1414 (same as Siembra Azul), Gran Dovejo is a top tier brand that is priced reasonably, yet I don’t see it mentioned much.  I’d put their High Proof Blanco up against almost anything out there, and they put out the best Single Barrel Añejo I’ve ever had (wish I could get more).

She would have known before hand that she would have had to promote something like that in night clubs and other parties. 

I always thought she would have been more successful if she had picked something to do with horses or animals. A smaller market, sure, but at least it would have been something she could talk about with some sort of authority.

**Training**

I started going to the gym last September consistently for the first time, pretty much ever.  I was going hiking in the Himalayas and didn't want to die up there, so I did lots of core and legs, and Stairmaster for cardio.  I had been sitting at a desk my whole career, and was overweight, had back problems, poor strength, and no cardio fitness.  

After surviving the trip and really feeling good about the fitness improvements I got, I started going to the gym regularly (3-5 times a week after work).  Started out mostly doing core and strength and some cardio, but  somewhere along the way got to where I was looking forward to the run at the end the most.  Fast forward 8 months later, I am still a bit heavier than I'd like, but I've lost weight and my body has transformed into something I am actually proud of now.  I'll be willing to take off my shirt at the pool for the first time in 20 years this summer.

When I signed up for this, I started doing some practice 5k runs at my local park on Saturdays.  My best ""5k"" time was 33:36, and I had to walk three times toward the end.  My goal was to beat that time, and never to walk.  My friend who ran with me told me that running with other people would help, and he was right.

**Race**

I took a Ucan superstarch gel 30 mins before the race.  I am sure it wasn't necessary but I am a planner, and every little thing helps.  I'd had peanut butter toast and coffee 3 hours before, so I wasn't hungry, but some consistent energy was appealing.  I had lots of energy the whole race, so I am telling myself it worked.

I signed up as a 30-40 minute bracket runner, knowing I was very likely going to finish in the 33-34 minute range based on practice.  We started in the second group, but with chips in the bibs my time would be accurate.

The race started off with a half-mile downhill.  It was hard to not run at full tilt but I set a max heartrate alert (165 for me at 49 yrs) on my Apple watch, and slowed down whenever it went off (at least for the first half).  I think that was a big help to me.  I'd tried using pacing before, but I'm not consistent in my pace yet.  The HR alert was good though.  By about half a mile I was already passing people who were walking from the sub-30 group.  There was a water stop along the route at 1.1 miles, and I had a small sip.  

The race was an out-and-back, and when I got to the turnaround I was feeling amazing.  No pain, focused on my breathing, and using my 140bpm Spotify playlist to pace my running.  I was following a guy and his step-daughter (we chatted over tacos later) and they set a good pace for me.

The last half mile was the uphill that we'd run down at the start.  It seemed like everyone was walking, but I followed a guy who kept running, and I was passing dozens of people on the hill.  I slowed my pace but didn't stop.  When I saw the finish I sprinted.  It was awesome!  

**Post-race**

I got a medal and a sombrero and waited for my friend to finish.  We went and got some water, then got in line for some Beto's tacos and a margerita.  

I was thrilled with my time.  I'd tried training on the treadmill at a 6 mph (10 min mile) pace and never could make it to 5k, but today I did it!  I told my friend I want to sign up for another 5k and start training for something longer.  I could have kept running at the end.

I'd highly recommend this race.  It was very well organized, and everyone was having a great time.

3782,2023-04-18 13:25:46-05:00,1681842346.0,tequila,t5_2ri8c,"As you can probably tell from my post history or comments on this sub, Cascahuin is my favorite distillery. And if I'm being honest with myself I may be a bit biased, the distillery is in my families hometown (grandma lives 5 blocks away) but nevertheless they've been consistently producing a quality tequila since 1904. Back in February we did a tour at the distillery where we tried the 6 bottles in this picture, here are my rankings listed from favorite to least favorite.

**Tahona Blanco**: My favorite without a doubt, super agave forward and the minerality makes a great balance. It's not too sweet yet not too earthy with just a touch of citrus and heat, a great representation of the agaves grown in this region. This is the tequila that started my hunt for good blancos.

**Extra Anejo**: Im usually a blanco drinker, but this extra anejo is something else. It's sweet but the barrel definitely stands out. I was impressed how the aging process didn't take over the smell of agave. It has some heat at first but then the cooked agave takes over. Also a favorite for a couple of my whiskey drinking buddies.

**Tie between Blanco and Plata 48**: So hear me out both are great and I'd drink both without hesitation but the biggest factor that made me put the blanco in this spot is price. The Plata is is ideal for someone who enjoys high proof spirits, both are similar in characteristics, agave forward, citrus and some heat but the Plata is obviously more ethanol forward in taste and smell (48% abv compared to 38%). And although the Plata 48 has more alcohol, it's not over powering which is impressive and deserving of a high rank. Both are great in a cocktail but when you buy a case of 12 (yes we literally buy 12 bottles of the same tequila) you can't beat the Blanco at only $300 pesos a bottle. At that price it's not a big deal if you spill a little as you pour.

**Reposado**: I didn't think I'd put the repo at 5 on the list cause honestly it was one of my favorites when i first started drinking tequila. Also agave forward (common theme with Cascahuin) with hints of caramel/vanilla and sweetness. Almost no minerality compared to the blanco but still retains some of that fruity citrus smell.

**Anejo**: Don't get me wrong I still enjoy this tequila but it ultimately came down personal prefrence, I would buy the repo over anejo. It's not too sweet and more oak/barrel laden to the nose. I'd say it's more similar to the repo than the extra anejo. Super smooth and a great finish and not a bad price for the amount of time and effort necessary for producing an aged spirit.

Overall it was a great experience being able to try all the options Cascahuin has in stock at they're distillery store. I can't say it enough but I highly recommend a tour here, by far one of the best in the region. Big props to our paisanos the Rosales family for keeping up with tradition and passing it on to the next generation and thanks to our host/primo Tetsu for all the questions answered and patience for our group of 18.

Salud! 🥂

Ex. How drinking a certain tequila makes me tired but drinking Clase for instance makes me feel more energetic? Is that because of the added sweeteners?

 I am very sensitive to certain alcohols and how they affect my mood/body. For instance, I can't drink gin because it makes me woozy and nauseous.

Smells just like tequila should smell. Mainly agave but then again my sinuses have been shot due to allergies.
Sharp agave taste up front, spicy after taste with a warm feeling going down. Definitely leaves an agave mouth feel after. 

G4
Lighter agave nose with some citrus backing it up.
Mix of flavors up front. Where cenote comes on with agave and lights up as it goes down g4 is just a mellow mix of floral and earthy tones. G4 has earth tones I expect in mezcal but isn’t overpowering like mescal.

Ocho widow Jane
Sharp agave nose with little to no bourbon hints in it. If anything it made my stomach grumble in a good way for agave. 
Taste is a sharp agave taste up front. The only way I can describe the sharpness is like the difference between sharp and mild cheddar. Definitely has a whiskey oily mouth feel long after the drink has gone down. I would say the bourbon opens up long after the drink has been swallowed. Very short mouth feel before the oily taste of bourbon steps in.",t2_c2jq76u,"Tasting notes for G4 blanco, Tequila Ocho Widow Jane, Cenote as a control",t3_12k5gzp,12k5gzp,suppahotfire702,18,https://i.redd.it/bm83awux7lta1.jpg,0.97,63,tequila,0.3672337532043457,0.1576666980981826,0.1397887915372848,0.0327675938606262,0.0388474725186824,0.0697215646505355,0.086866907775402,0.0322156213223934,0.0429028868675231,0.0319887697696685,0.9957502484321594,0.004249733407050371

As it was Cinco De Mayo, and because like members of this group, I take this responsibility seriously, it took me quite a while to select bottles for the gathering.  Several bottles were taken out and returned, such as Widow Jane, Curado Repo, Winter Blend '21 and of course bottles of Siembra and Tapatio Anejo (which I have been loving). 

[The final line-up for Cinco de Mayo.](https://preview.redd.it/pf9a26q1s7ya1.png?width=4032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a2f4d9f3bb1f13eb33a3ecab7cb201b12432f508)

  
I would like to say I planned the final line up, but it happened by accident that I ended up with Two Blancos (Villa Lobos Distillation and Primo 1861) Two Repos (El Tesoro, Fortaleza WB22) , Two Anejos (Fortaleza and El Luchador) and Two XAs (Rey Sol and Diablito).  However, I thought it was a great, if perhaps uneven spread.  Anecdotal winners were no surprise, Rey Sol and Fortaleza WB22.  That said, the Villa Lobos is absolutely one of my favorite HP tequilas and the El Luchador is one of my favorite Anejos.   
We did not get to all of them. And I'm sure that's for the best. Would love to hear any feedback about the line-up and what I might have done to round it out better?  What would you have added or subtracted?  Real question.  Also, I am mindful not to post any unopened bottles. These are all well-loved (and in some cases drinking the back-up bottle).",t2_62t5n4aq,"""Your Eyes are Bigger than your Capacity to Drink Tequila""",t3_139oept,139oept,bloomeanie311,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/tequila/comments/139oept/your_eyes_are_bigger_than_your_capacity_to_drink/,0.92,27,tequila,0.2098965495824813,0.0040196343325078,0.6001424789428711,0.020663158968091,0.039105374366045,0.0697147995233535,0.0133797330781817,0.0122742755338549,0.0129478899762034,0.0178560204803943,0.9952095150947571,0.004790487699210644

Plenty of people Ive talked to about it in Jalisco swear they can tell the difference between a Mexican bought tequila vs the exported version of the same brand and aging level. Of course they say the MX version is better.

I woke up at 2am like I normally do but still kinda fuzzy. Poured out my last shot(dammit) and spilled OJ on the carpet. I decided not to go into work so I called out; left a message. 

I’m now sitting here with a belly full of kratom, and a fridge filled with good food. I shouldn’t drink today but really wish I had that last shot. I got some weed so that’s good. I’m gonna take bong rips and coffee sips as this kratom gives me a nice blanket of “Fuck it.”

They offer tours for 500 pesos per person which includes 3 tequila samples (Blanco, Reposado, and Anejo) and a cantarito cocktail that you can enjoy in their bar/restaurant. The castle is very impressive, its facades are adorned with volcanic stones and it does not lack a great photo opportunity. Its factory is under construction but will soon produce tequila for master distiller Gildardo Partida, founder of Addictivo, Tierra Sagrada, and Lote Maestro. Along with the factory that is nearly completed, there are also plans to build a high-rise hotel in the shape of their iconic twisted bottle. 

The tour mostly consisted of amazing views, perfect scenes for a picture, storytelling, and insight from our guide. El Castillo de Tequila's brands are all produced at Tequilera Puerta de Hierro (Nom1477) which is right next door and also immediate family to Gildardo. One of the most impressive features is a huge mural that depicts the origins of tequila, thanks to our tour guide we got a full panoramic picture of it. There are views of the agave landscape from almost every section of the top floors, including a glass bridge that made me a little nervous when our big group crossed it. My personal favorite part of the tour took place in the basement full of American and French oak barrels, a smell I still recall to this day. 

We tried Addictivo Plata first, which I’ve had before, and currently have a sealed bottle of it at home. Mostly agave and vanilla to the nose and taste but the sweet/vanilla overpowers the cooked agave taste in the back end. Addictivo Reposado was my favorite of the three samples, it was still sweet but the barrel aging helped mask the sweetness on the back end. The anejo is a little too sweet for me, it almost completely hides the agave but I do enjoy the wood and barrel taste. The tour ends with a cantarito in the bar area where you can also order food and enjoy your refreshing cocktail. 

The tour was about an hour long and in my opinion, is not catered towards a tequila connoisseur wanting to have a deeper insight, but I’m sure that will change when the factory is producing tequila. My least favorite part about El Castillo is there is a sense of inauthenticity, it almost feels like a manufactured point of entertainment that opened before it was ready so it wouldn’t miss out on the increase in tourism that the area is experiencing. Also, Addictivo is not something I’m going to recommend as I don’t think it showcases the characteristics of tequila from the Valles Region (call it Addeditivo in the comments all ya want). 

El Castillo is by far a head-turner and you can’t miss it as you drive into El Arenal, its location is ideal for tourists along the paisaje agavero.  Overall it’s a fun experience where we got a ton of pictures, and although it’s not a tour I would highly recommend, I’ll give it another shot when the factory is complete. I promise I didn't write this with the intention of it being a shitpost or down-talking Addictivo, just me being candid. Nevertheless, the Partida Hermosillo family is responsible for too many brands to list, and being ranked #22 out of 114 distilleries on TMM makes me proud to call them my paisanos.

I wanted to try the new Kirkland blanco and repo and must say I was beyond impressed. I would rather not drink at all over drinking a bad product (regardless of price) but this not only is so inexpensive but also quality in line with some of my favorites (Ocho, Sieta Leguas, Lalo, etc). I dont understand how they can make this cost so little with such good quality. Yes, its not an artisan tequila but still impressive. I am allergic to most additives some of the popular brands put in their product so this is my new go to for parties.

Highly highly recommended

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ubfdx/aita_for_throwing_my_brothers_alcoholism_back_in/)**: April 21, 2023**

For context: I (20F) in the US where the drinking age is 21.

Both of my parents died by the time I was 10. My older brother, Charlie (then 19, now 29), ghosted. He was an alcoholic and felt it was all too much. It’s a choice I now understand as an adult, but as a kid, of course it hurt. I was raised by both my grandmother and older sister, Renee (then 17, now 27). My grandmother did all she could, but she was older and relied on Renee a lot.

When I was 17, Charlie came back into our lives, 2 years sober. Renee and I forgave him. I am now very close to him and we’ve bonded a lot. I actually live with him now while I go to college because he lives literally right up the road.

I do party on occasion, but it’s very rare I get drunk. Now, I always assumed that Charlie knew I drank. I’m in college. Not every college student parties, but when I’m at out past midnight, I figure it’s obvious I’m not playing Scrabble or whatever.

I crashed at a friend’s on Wednesday night after having a bit too much to drink. I returned to Charlie’s, hungover. It wasn’t quite obvious at first but then I started throwing up. He figured it out and began lecturing me. Said I’m 20, not legally able to drink, it’s not safe to get wasted at a college party. Told me that I shouldn’t drink at all at my age. He wasn’t yelling, more matter of fact than anything.

I wasn’t feeling great, had a headache and found his rant hypocritical. I told him such. He started drinking at 15, had a huge problem at 19. He abandoned our family when we needed him most. He has no right to judge me or act like a protective big brother now. Charlie got quiet, walked out of the room and later left for work. He hasn’t said much to me since. He’s definitely not mad, just sad and hurt.

Renee told me I crossed a line. While she’s fine with me drinking and thinks Charlie overreacted a little, she said I went way too far in throwing back all that in his face. Especially as I’ve never brought it up before. She says the most I should’ve said was that I was safe while drinking and I understood his concern, but I could do what I wanted as an adult.

I’m starting to feel bad. Was I wrong?

***Relevant Comments:***

*Someone points out brother may have been worried for her safety:*

""I didn’t consider that he was worried about me being vulnerable around guys. I just thought he was talking about driving, which I didn’t do. I walked to a friend’s dorm.""

*You share a genetic predisposition for alcoholism:* 

""While I don’t think I have a problem, our mom was a heroin addict and it contributed to her death. Her mom was an alcoholic. Pretty sure her sister was too. So, it is genetic. Doesn’t mean I have it, but the commenter and my brother aren’t wrong to be concerned, I’m learning.""

""Yeah, I didn’t know much about the genetic part but when you said it and I look at our family history…you’re not far off. I don’t think I have a problem but it certainly is genetic in our family.""

*Many people point out just how much OOP overreacted:* 

""You’re absolutely right. I’m definitely becoming embarrassed.""

*It wasn't your brother's responsibility to care for you:*

""I don’t think he had a responsibility to take care of anyone. I do think he had a responsibility to just not up and leave. So maybe people are right. Maybe I am not really over it.""

""I’ve thought about therapy a lot. I guess it’s time to think about it more.""

**Update (Same Post): April 22, 2023 (Next Day)**

Update: First of all, thank you for being so honest with me. A lot of it was very hard to read and I didn’t want to accept it, but I know I needed to.

I still do not think I have a drinking problem. I know that’s what every alcoholic says, but I truly do not get as drunk as I did that often. At the same time, I recgonize addiction is genetic and Charlie is not the only person in our family that struggles with it. Considering that, I am going to take a break from drinking for a little while and if/when I start again in the future (after I turn 21 at a minimum), I will be more careful when it comes to how much I consume and the venue in which I consume it.

A lot of you pointed out that Charlie was right about the safety concern. I was getting wasted at a college party. I didn’t include this in the post, which is unfair looking back as it’s important context, but none of my friends were sober either. So, I had no one looking out for me nor was I looking out for myself. I see now all the things that could’ve happened.

The big takeaway is that I am not “okay” or “over” with what happened. I buried it down because I just wanted a relationship with my brother again and then as soon as I was reminded of that time, I lashed out. I plan to look into finding a therapist because clearly, there’s a lot of unresolved issues.

Finally, I knew early on after posting that I owed Charlie an apology. I ordered dinner for us last night and apologized. I said I understood that he was concerned and he had every right to be. I also said I had no right to throw everything back in his face. Charlie apologized for everything he put the family through, but I told him that he already had. He repeated that he was just very worried about me turning into him. I thanked him for his concern and told him I’m grateful for him, I love him.

I am not foolish to think everything is okay. He knows now that I’m struggling with everything. I also can’t take back the words I said or what a brat I was. But we’re going to try moving forward and find healing.

Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

Hello friends, it’s great to be here with you not drinking on this Monday! It was honestly incredible to read everyone’s supportive comments to each other yesterday. You are all amazing. A high five to all the high fives! 

Today, I wanna talk about **triggers**. Gross. But learning about my triggers and how to plan / cope is something that really helped me.

My triggers fall into a few categories: bad times, good times, and habits. I’d start off most days thinking that I wouldn’t drink. Then 5pm would roll around (the dreaded witching hour!) and I’d lose my resolve. Just one wouldn’t hurt right? (Yeah, we all know where that is heading…)

When I started this streak, I decided to make a plan ahead of each trigger. This was helpful for habits and good time triggers. I also set out to learn new coping tools for the bad times that I couldn’t plan for.  A good plan helps but there’s always something out of your control, so I think about plans as my starting point - then try to be flexible as real life unfolds.

For me, planning for a trigger could look like:
* completely mixing up my routine for the first month so I wouldn’t have the 5PM witching hour at home alone
* making sure the house is stocked up with food / non-alcoholic drinks
* looking at the menu for bars / restaurants ahead of time so I have a plan for what I’d drink (and deciding on my back-up option if nothing is worth it: soda water or water). I do want to go back to the days of just having tap water at restaurants exclusively though to save money, lol.
* making a list of fun activities to do around the city for free/ low cost 
* scheduling time with friends and family

How about you - Has planning for triggers helped you in the past, or what do you find most helpful for dealing with triggers?

Hey friends, it’s Thursday! Thanks everyone for sharing your fav NA drinks yesterday. The ones I can’t wait to try are sparkling water with fruit juice added (wow game changer), adding a lil hot sauce to drinks (!!), and fruit shrubs (I still don’t really know what these are but it sounds good!).

Today, I wanna talk about **REST and relaxing**. Learning to relax again has brought me a lot of joy and relief in recovery.

I am also a recovering perfectionist. I had a terrible time saying no to things and an even worse time setting unrealistic goals and expectations for myself. Wine was a way to slow my brain completely down to nothing and shut off for the night. My problematic drinking really started at a period when I burnt myself out from work.

When I started therapy, I told my therapist that I couldn’t relax. I dreaded evenings at home alone because I didn’t want to drink and I didn’t enjoy any of the typical home relax activities. 

I later found out that alcohol increases anxiety after 15 minutes or so. So that ‘relaxing’ glass of wine was making it impossible for me to relax. Whilst I blamed myself for not being able to relax, alcohol was creating both the problem and the need for it as a solution.

These last few months, I’ve rediscovered that I can relax. WHO KNEW.  It is such a relief to be able to find joy and comfort in chilling again. My anxiety is soo much better.
 
One surprising thing that my therapist taught me was that rest looks different for every person. I might not enjoy vegging out watching TV all night, and that’s totally cool (also totally cool for anyone who does enjoy that). My rest might look more like watching a specific movie, reading a book, playing guitar, going for a walk, cooking, etc. It helped me to learn that rest is very individual and that I shouldn’t have a specific expectation about resting for myself. 

Making sure I have enough rest time is still a WIP but it’s been cool to see progress on my anxiety, being able to relax, and setting boundaries.

Today I’d love to hear: What does rest look like for you - how do you like to relax when you’re not drinking ?

Hey friends, we are here on this Tuesday to not drink today, go us! It was really helpful to hear how everyone was approaching triggers yesterday - one thing I love about this community is that we all have such different experiences to bring. It’s like the world’s largest crowdsourced advice in one place so everyone can see what works for others, take what works, and leave the rest. 

Today, I’d love to talk about **mindfulness**. If you do it already, you’re probably like 'hell yeah!' If you don’t do it, you’re probably not AT ALL enthused by this topic. Mindfulness is one of those things that sounds ridiculous until it sticks. I have a ridiculously overactive mind and never thought I could do it. But now it is so helpful for me. I even give it a ton of credit for getting me to consider not drinking.

Late last year, I read the book ‘Unwinding Anxiety’. It is targeted at anxiety, but the writer is a neuroscientist who treats many people with addictions, from smoking and eating to alcohol. As I was reading, it made me think about applying the techniques to my drinking as well.

HIGHLY recommend the book for anyone who is anxious, but the drinking part that got me thinking was about using mindfulness to explore how drinking **actually** felt. This made realize that I wasn’t even enjoying drinking. The main tool taught in the book is using awareness to see how your body is feeling in response to something, to get curious about it, and label it. This process disconnects you from your automatic response. For example, during a drink, I took a step back to look at how my body actually felt.  (i.e. heart racing / head cloudy / etc). This got me to finally notice the anxiety inducing effects and how alcohol wasn’t adding any value to my experience, when usually I’d just think about getting another drink.

The other tool that I have found incredibly helpful here is the meditation app Balance. I’ve tried meditation SO many times over the years but Balance’s free year trial got it to finally stick. They have lessons to teach you day by day instead of throwing you in the deep end. Somehow trying to sit still for 5-15 min without learning any meditation skills did not work for me in the past, lol.

Both of these tools have helped me to slow down away from my automatic emotional response, so I can learn new habits and respond differently to what is going on.

Today, I’d love to hear: Has mindfulness / meditation helped you in your journey or do you have another tool you'd recommend instead?

Hey friends, I’m glad that we are all here on this Wednesday, whatever time is it where you are in the world. 

Today, I wanna talk about **non-alcoholic beverages**. Not specifically the non-alcoholic versions of alcoholic drinks. Instead, the whole WORLD of drinks out there that don’t contain any alcohol! (including good old water!)

When I was drinking, I thought it was such a waste of calories to drink anything that wasn’t water, coffee, or alcohol. I never paid attention to any non-alcoholic options. I even remember wondering what the hype was behind this popular new seltzer, if there wasn’t any booze in it? (Looking back in hindsight… lol).

Since I stopped drinking, I’ve discovered that there’s a ridiculous amount of drinks that don’t have alcohol?! And they taste AMAZING?!  

For me, having a delicious non-alcoholic drink relieves a lot of the cravings. I realized that I often missed the ritual rather than the alcohol. What’s cool to see is that there are more and more elevated drink options being created that are non-alcoholic first - so just a fun unique drink that has no relation to alcohol. Usually low sugar too. Very here for that!

My favorites so far: fun sparkling water (shout out to Barbet if you are also in Canada!), and sodas from around the world (try ethnic / niche supermarkets and have a blast!). I’m hoping to learn some fun mocktail recipes this summer too.

Question for today - Have non-alcoholic drinks helped you in any way? We’d love to hear your experiences. Even if it's water! If so, tell us which ones are your favorite so we can give em a try! :)

It’s Friday SD — the day that used to get me. When I was *trying* to quit, I’d not drink during the week, then lose it Friday through Sunday. It was pointless and stupid and I was sick so often. Finally I *Decided* I wasn’t going to live in that endless spin cycle any longer. I was done. And I threw all of my energy into living a sober life. For me that meant a sober counting app to calculate time and money saved, reading Alcohol Explained, This Naked Mind and The Unexpected Joy of Being Sober.  It meant lots of seltzer and juice and exercise and so much time spent here on SD. All of the things. And yes, I still have battles, but I’ve also got tools as the work continues.

One last thought since it’s Friday - there are tons of us out there and We Are the Cool Kids 😎 Really.  Google Sober Celebrities and you’ll be amazed. The lists go on and on and on. Artists, actors, musicians, businesspeople. On and on ❤️ Happy Friday SD! I’m so grateful to say IWNDWYT and am sending love to all of you. Let’s Go!

Hello friends, it’s awesome to see you here today! This is my very first time hosting, and WOW it feels weird to be here. I hit four months sober last week, and this sub has been a huge part of that.

Huge thanks to u/PeacefulToday for hosting last week - loved the tone that you set for the week!

I’m “Sea-Independence-605” - this randomly generated username seemed way too appropriate when I created an account for this sub. Independent from the sea of alcohol, let’s give this a shot!

A little bit about me: My drinking became problematic when I had a very toxic job with a lot of free booze (advertising, if anyone relates!) and a toxic relationship, whilst being surrounded by many heavy drinkers.

This week, I'll share some of the things that have helped me the most so far. I’m still learning (four months streak) and this still feels very new, so I look forward to learning from you too.

Today: let’s talk about the DCI! My very first comment in the DCI was scary. I didn’t know what to expect. But each day, I received more supportive comments and upvotes. Each day, I felt a little better and learnt something to help me move forward.

For a while, I was WAY too nervous to reply to people here. Me, having anything to say to people with all my problems? I did not feel like I could possibly have anything to add.

But one day, another DCI host encouraged us all to reply to someone else (thank you!). And I realized I was being silly. Shame and hiding myself away just feeds the drinking. Regardless of where I’m at, I can contribute and encourage others. That process has been so helpful to me, to feel like a part of this supportive community.

So today if you have the time: reply back to someone else here to give them a HIGH FIVE for being here today. Sort by New and spread the good vibes around. Today we are not drinking, and that’s bloody awesome!

Today is trash day in my neighborhood. It sure used to stress me out — forgetting to get the dumpsters to the curb. Hiding empty bottles under other items under dark of night. Praying no one heard me. You know the drill. Feeling that suffocating shame So Many Times.

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Happy Tuesday. A few thoughts for the day that I’ve read this week:

*Look where you’re headed not where you don’t want to end up. (Big thanks to u/sainthomer for all of the tools he shared yesterday and mad respect for his 2,000 days!) 🙏😇

*What you do a lot, you get better at. ❤️ So keep doing what helps. 

*Rock bottom is simply where you stop digging.  

*Getting sober is the best thing you’ve ever done.  

And Shout out to Lurkers, I’m sending all good vibes your way. I well remember being scared to death the first time I posted here. And everyone was so kind, the fear left. This sub is always ready when you are.

Over the weekend I brought a case of beer as thanks to the skydiving school where I got my license during my IOP program.  I brought carona for the beer fridge in the hanger, and brought a 6 pack of non-alcoholic carona so I could “drink with the bros” after skydiving.  

I thought it was a good way for me to participate in the culture while not drinking.

When I told my therapist about it today, she essentially shamed me and said that drinking NA beer is just as bad as drinking real alcohol because it uses the same neuro pathways.  And that it’s not abstaining because there’s &lt;0.5% alcohol in the drinks.  

I only had two of these NA caronas over the weekend, and was happy with everything regarding the situation.  But after her telling me that “it’s just as bad as drinking,” I’m a little peeved.

Anyway, I didn’t feel comfortable telling her that I disagreed.  But wanted to reach out for some support.  If it’s just as bad as actually drinking, why shouldn’t I go grab some real beer?

Love you guys.

Edit: my issue with alcohol was that I’d get drunk at cut myself.  And one day I got drunk and tried to commit suicide.  I didn’t have problems with “social drinking” and drinking NA beer with some dudes was far from a trigger for me.

Edit 2: not a single person I hang out with has ever “expected” me to drink, or asked me if I’ve wanted to.

Incredibly grateful to be here.  Namaste SD. I’m bowing to the divine in each of you. 🙏 And of course IWNDWYT

Happy Sober Sunday to all and thanks for the chance to host for a 2nd time ❤️ When I joined Reddit specifically to join this sub I was anxious, scared and desperately trying to stay sober. Choosing the name Peaceful Today was a big hope and prayer cause I was surely not peaceful. I’d  lurked for a while and couldn’t believe the kindness and support on this sub was real. And man but you all show every day how real it is! 

I’ve been re-reading the book We Are the Luckiest and this jumped out at me:  “I come back. Each new day that I am here without dimming myself by drinking, I have a chance to come back and try again. And I do” Sounds like our team to me 😎

Would love to hear a favorite quote or book that’s helped if you want to share. 

Today life is not without problems, but it’s an awesome gift to be clear and present for All of It. No longer dimming myself or my life.

Wow but you Showed Up yesterday SD! Loved your quotes and recommendations and shares. All were a gift as is this Monday. 

Never underestimate the impact your choice to be sober may have on someone else. A year ago I was about a year sober, and saw my best friend for life who lives a 10 hour drive from me. We had a great visit and she saw that I was truly sober and different. 

Six months later she told me some big, positive changes she made in her life were inspired by seeing me sober. “If Peaceful can quit drinking, I can do this.” I would never have expected that and was blown away. 

But then I think about this sub and the wisdom and kindness shared here every day that change lives. Why on earth would I be surprised. It’s just one more ripple of what originates in this awesome community. I’ve gotta say, you’re all courageous heroes to me. 

Would love to hear any favorite or surprising changes or impacts sobriety has brought your way.

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)and  have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me   and   feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a   long   time and want to inspire others.

It     doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or     been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a     sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*.     It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes     impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person     can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**      A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the  next    24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and  making a    pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any  time, you    do not have to be a regular at [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:**     A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek     advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response  in    your own thread.

I’ve never liked reality shows boozing up their contestants however I do acknowledge it makes for good TV, on the other hand must they show it so much and almost edit it in?? Like why is that such a focus when the show has nothing to do with that. And it’s kind of an unhealthy culture to promote to people especially young viewers. I think my biggest problem too is it interferes with knowing what interactions are genuine and which ones aren’t because if they’re drunk it’s kind of hard to take their word??? So many issues. Bottom line it just doesn’t need to be such a large part of the show.

Edit: I would like to say that in posting this I was simply sharing my opinion, please stop telling me it’s my fault and shouldn’t watch the show. This is a place where we literally are sharing our opinions on a TV show, that’s the whole point of this subreddit. I understand everyone’s opinions as well, but please be respectful and also remember we are ALL allowed to share our opinions, myself included. This was just supposed to be a critique on the show, and people clearly misunderstood my use of the word “triggering”. The fact that that became the main focus of this post is mainly because people nowadays don’t like that word. Please read my entire post before judging. Thank you.

Second edit: Never expected this post to blow up this big, and while there has been a lot of hate directed towards this post there has also been an outpouring of support which I think is beautiful. I also think it’s amazing to see those who shared their opinions in the right way and felt comfortable to share those! I’m really happy this post actually sparked some important conversations.

1. My brother ordered a single drink for his first birthday celebration since being out of the church. One of his longtime friends who is very TBM happened to bring her high school daughters unannounced. After the party, she called him saying that they were so disappointed and on their drive home, she had to have a “hard conversation” with her daughters when they said “I can’t believe he was drinking alcohol in front of us.”

2. My close friend’s husband was drinking a beer, and her dad confronted him saying “I can’t believe you have the nerve to drink that in front of me.”

3. My father-in-law has been out for a while, but my TBM sister-in-law often calls us and vents about finding alcohol in his fridge whenever she visits him. (She doesn’t know we’re out.)

And now, here we are, this same sister-in-law from the above is coming to visit us this weekend and we’re trying to finish our alcohol as quickly as we can so we don’t “offend her”. But I’m here trying to think of WHY does this offend people. I understand they feel hurt because we’re “dooming our salvation”, but I’m genuinely trying to wrap my head around being sad about it vs. being offended over it and how to respectfully move forward with this.

EDIT: I’m not ready to discuss this with family members, but I also don’t intend to keep this a secret for my whole life. This is preparing me for when I’m ready to have this discussion with family. Please be respectful that I want to take this at my own pace.

Maybe you're new to [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)  and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and  feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long  time and want to inspire others.

It  doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or  been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a  sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*.  It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes  impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person  can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**   A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next  24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a  pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you  do not have to be a regular at [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:**  A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek  advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in  your own thread.

Happy Wednesday you fine folk

One thing I really enjoy are the motivational quotes or sayings people use to help them through a tough day or just as a reminder of better things ahead.

Please share the ones that resonate for you, you never know how much it might help.

"" I understand now that I'm not a mess but a deeply feeling person in a messy world. I explain that, now when someone asks me why I cry so often. I say "" For the same reason I laugh so much, because I am paying attention""   *Glennon Doyle Melton*

"" You can't go back and change the beginning, but you can start where you are and change the ending.""  *C S Lewis*

Thanks for sharing the quotes that have inspired you. I really enjoyed reading them.

When I was thinking about what to say today I kept thinking about how far I have come since I stopped drinking a year ago. I think it's really important to take the time occasionally to appreciate how far all of us have come since we made that life changing choice. Whether it's day one or day 1000 we have all made a massively positive decision.

I'm proud to be part of this group.

One added bonus of hosting this week is I get to make a huge fuss of my good sober friend u/brighter68 who is now a full year sober!!! One whole trip around the sun shining brightly.

She has been a huge inspiration for me, always there with kind words and encouragement. and happy to share the ups and downs of this tricky journey. Thank you so much for everything and Congratulations my dear friend!!

This place is such a wonderful community, there are so many kind generous beautifully flawed humans here, ready and willing to help. It was all I needed to get me through the first few difficult months. There are many avenues you can take to reach sobriety and everyone has different path to take but for me this was the place that I felt at home, I was with my people. I felt connected again after shutting myself off.

Boss calls, mild panic attack. Start to cold sweat so much i can smell the stink in the car. Think about just turning around fuck it i cant handle this today. Get to the first client, the anxiety hits again and i fuck up a word or something. Cold sweats.

So sorry about the date mix up yesterday. For some reason the computer generated form is out of date. I know to look for it now.

I've been thinking today about how different I feel this time hosting compared to 6 months ago. I had everything pre planned the first time. I had been thinking about it for weeks leading up to hosting. Now it is a much more casual thing. Still extremely important to me but more comfortable.

It's very much like my journey through sobriety, in the beginning it was all I thought about. It was my identity. Now it is a part of me but not all of me. So, for those just starting out, please know it does get easier, stick in there. It will change for the better and so will you.

Its Friday!! Woop woop.

I used to be scared of Fridays and the weekend when I first started this journey. Old habits and all that. 

In the beginning I slowed my life right down as I adjusted to my new lifestyle. I knew it would be much harder otherwise. Now I am back to going out without much trepidation. Tonight I'm off to the rugby and as is the world over, sport is heavily associated with drinking. This will be my second game this season and I know I do not need to drink expensive stadium beers to have a good time.

Its nice to know that the sacrifice you make in the beginning doesn't last. Your life will go back to normal. A newer better normal. One that doesn't involve shame and regret.

Hosting the daily check in is such a rewarding thing to do. I wished I hosted earlier on  as it connects you more to this great sub. Please get a hold of u/sainthomer if you have more than 30 days under your belt.

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision **not to drink**  It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:**  A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I love to hear from all my sober buddies and draw inspiration from you all.

Thank you for all the supportive messages yesterday, I had completely forgotten about my counter and reaching 100 days again. It's kind of difficult to believe that I'm back in triple digits already because those awful relapse days are still so fresh in my mind. And I think that's what I'd like to do today, work through that I mean. 

I remember it was on a Wednesday afternoon because I was driving when the notion that a drink sounded good hit me. I only drive on Wednesdays because I have my therapist appointment that day. And the instant that that thought hit me should've triggered alarm bells. It should've prompted me find any other possible activity I could do to distract myself long enough so that the thought vanished. I had practiced this security drill hundreds of times before. But the system was faulty that day. 

""Isn't it nice,"" I remember telling myself, ""just to have a drink and relax."" I was alternating between taking drags from a cigarette and gulping down some canned cocktail drink. ""There's something to be said for being able to enjoy one drink and then be able to stop,"" I said very self-assuredly. Flash forward about three hours or so and I'm about ten drinks in and making my way to happy hour at my old favorite bar. I vividly remember opening the creaky door for the first time in well over a year. It was like I never left. The same people. In the same spots. I took up mine at the end of the bar. ""A Ruthie,"" asked the bartender. Had I been dreaming my sobriety all along? Had nothing changed? ""Yes, thank you,"" I replied, a bit shocked she remembered. 

I continued to sink further and further into that dark void. With each passing day I felt more lost and I knew the opportunity to turn this back around and regain some momentum was slipping away. There's a scene in the show Maid on Netflix, a montage where someone relapses and they are shown going in and and out of the front door, over and over again, carrying alcohol. That's what my life became. I had crossed that threshold and no longer cared about anything else. ""There's something to be said for being able to enjoy one drink and then be able to stop."" What a joke. 

It was only after visiting my mother that my little routine came to a halt. I had brought my boys and while they were keeping her busy I was sneaking out, drinking tallboys in parking lots and then racing home. For some reason I was picking beers with 10% ABV, My belief is is that I wanted to get caught, because I drank so many so fast that there was no hiding it anymore. I rushed inside and told my mom we needed to talk. But when I went to speak I couldn't breathe. I was hyperventilating. And tears were streaming down my face. And my three year old saw the entire meltdown. And while I kept repeating that I couldn't do this anymore, I noticed his hand resting on my thigh while my mom's arm was wrapped around my body, seemingly holding it together and preventing my pounding heart from exploding out of my chest. 

And the next day I was back here. Ready to begin again.

I don’t care, and always make a huge effort to accommodate and as a general rule when she comes to stay my husband and I will prepare and eat whatever she eats. My only issue is that she can be a bit self righteous about it. 

We’re close, she has been there for me when literally no one else was, I love her dearly. But bare in mind she has alienated and hurt other friends based on her vegan opinions. She is opinionated and very much feels she is better than other people based off her decision to not eat animal products. 

We met up recently at my house, with a few other friends and were drinking and generally enjoying herself when I noticed that the wine she had opened was not the specific vegan wine I’d bought for the weekend but rather one that was just in the fridge.

I quickly pointed it out to her, but she had already had almost a whole glass. 

At this point she goes off on one that all wine is vegan and i’m being ridiculous, if I have an issue with certain wines being drunk (it was a pricey one that she was drinking but that wasn’t the problem) then it shouldn’t have been in the fridge. 

I pointed out that actually not all wine is vegan, she can drink what she wants but I thought she’d want to know it wasn’t vegan. 

She is now badmouthing me for “calling her out” and being a know it all on her diet in front of other friends….

I think I can confidently say that cooking saved my life. It really did. I’m not sure how good I am at it but it became a passion of mine once I quit drinking. One that I’ve dedicated a lot of time to. I’ve always been drawn to the culinary arts, I’d binge watch about any cooking show I could find and enjoyed looking through food magazines and books and admiring the savory, sweet, and exotic dishes. Good old food porn. I found that observing the preparation of dishes had a calming effect on me. There was something comforting about the sheer focus and energy involved in making all the ingredients work together harmoniously. It seemed like something I could get lost in. Something to help me forget, at least for a little bit. And a finished meal was something I could point to and say with some satisfaction, “I made that.” That fulfillment was tangible. I could taste it.  

After I got sober for the first time I began cooking every night. I was way too ambitious in the beginning given my total lack of experience. I’d spend hours searching for recipes and watching tutorials, and then excitedly return home with the required ingredients ready to conquer the kitchen. You know how when you go to a fast food restaurant and the picture of the sandwich looks enticing and delicious, so you order it but the actual sandwich looks a bit . . . different? That was every single entrée I tried to duplicate. But I was keeping myself busy. I was keeping my mind off the booze at critical hours. And I believed that I was getting better at something that brought me joy.  

I even took a couple classes. And that’s where things really took off. I had no idea how complex cooking was until I began learning about the correct use of spices. And I started developing my own dishes. Nothing crazy or anything, just tweaks here and there of popular plates. I discovered that I was consumed with cooking. I was subscribing to Cook’s and allrecipes. I started making my own pasta and tomato sauces. The time and care this could take is ludicrous, but I welcomed it. It was nice to be absorbed in something I thought was wholesome and ultimately nourishing. And the gathering of all this stuff. I could be found at this little corner store almost every day looking for something or other. A favorite pastime of mine became going to farmer’s markets. I loved the sheer abundance of goods. And I got to know some really cool people who found meaning in bringing this bounty to market. (I really want to grow a garden!) And of course I had to let others know about my burgeoning passion. The Tucci Cookbook rests on my coffee table, declaring to visitors that I am a Serious Foodie (his book Taste is awesome, especially the audio version because Stanley narrates it).  

But the best thing about cooking? It’s a way to give back. Taking the time to prepare a meal, and doing so with intention, care, and love, is a very intimate thing to do. It creates a moment to be shared and opens up the space to just talk and be together. We connect over food. Food brings us together in a way that few other things can. I’ve formed and strengthened many bonds over a good meal, and I derive genuine happiness from someone’s enjoyment of something I made. It's sustenance. Nutritional and well as spiritual. It’s a difficult feeling to describe. It’s certainly a poignant one. What’s my favorite dish to make? What my kids simply call (or chant when they’re excited and 'starving') 'Dad's cheesy mac."" 

I hope you have found something you are passionate about and that takes your mind off that blasted, rotten booze!

I recently read about this thing called the perpetual stew. It dates back to medieval times. Essentially cauldrons would be kept simmering while people continued tossing in random ingredients. I'm not exactly sure how something like this works without causing food poisoning, I'm sure the temperature plays a significant role. But it also seems to me that a fair amount of trust was required for this communal forever soup to work out. If I remember correctly, it's in one of the Game of Thrones books that Arya tossed in a crow after taking a bowl of soup. But I've never had crow so it could be delicious for all I know. 

I mention this perpetual stew not only because it both fascinates and confuses me but because I see a kind of perpetual stew of ideas always available here at SD. Everyday thousands of people stop by to grab a helping and get a little nourishment to get them through the day or get back on track. And every day people add to the stew, making it more flavorful with their own strategies and advice. It's a wonderful thing, this stew. it's comforting. it's warming. It's robust. And rather pungent. I've been pretty damn greedy over the years, sneaking extra helpings here and there. Luckily for me the pot is being replenished with each share and each message of encouragement and support. And I'm thankful for all of you who keep the soup on for anyone who needs it. 

It's been a real pleasure hosting again. Hopefully you (yes, you!) would like to take over the DCI for a week. If so, reach out to SaintHomer and he'll get you set up. 

Be kind to yourself. Be gentle with yourself. Say nice things about yourself. And take care.

Have you heard of this thing called mewing? I guess it has been around for a while after a couple orthodontists urged fellow practitioners to pay more attention to the relationship between breathing practices and the structural integrity of the jaw when treating patients. But after TikTok got a hold of it a few years ago mewing became a cultural phenomenon. Influencers claimed that after only a few weeks of mewing their jawlines had visibly sharpened, giving their face a more chiseled look. YouTube tutorials began cropping up and captured the attention of individuals looking to dramatically change the shape of their face, entranced by before and after photos supposedly documenting the stunning results of mewing. And yes, there's even a subreddit for it. 

To mew you gently close your lips together, make your top teeth lightly touch your bottom teeth, and place your tongue flat against the roof of your mouth while being sure not to touch the back of your front teeth. Now breath in and out through your nose. That’s it. That’s mewing. Some adherents suggest putting medical tape across your mouth at night, but I wouldn’t recommend it.  

I stumbled across all this while reading James Nestor’s incredible book called Breath. Nestor shows how something went terribly wrong with the way we breathe around the time of the first industrial revolution, leading to a host of health problems unknown to our ancestors. He largely attributes the increasing prevalence of respiratory and inflammatory diseases in modern societies to the forgotten art of nasal breathing. And he makes a compelling case backed by all sorts of scientific evidence that made my jaw drop. Apparently how we breathe is linked to just about everything functional about our bodies and minds. My lung capacity is directly related to my anxiety levels?? How slowly I breathe and how often (5.5 times per minute is recommended) somehow has something to do with my GI tract? Crazy shit. 

You’re no doubt wondering why I am talking about mewing and proper breathing techniques. Because when I’m not drinking I get interested in all sorts of things I never could have imagined. When I get stuck in that loophole of drink, my world becomes remarkably small. The only thing I’m curious about is the ABV of whatever beverage I’ve chosen. And then I’ll plop down on the couch and find something to watch that sounds interesting but will ultimately fail to hold my attention. But I’ll dutifully sit there and stare at the glowing screen, mouth undoubtedly agape sucking in air. 

But sober me is concerned about my health and takes the time to read how to optimize it. Sober me is performing breathing exercises that I’ve been led to believe will heal my mind and body. I sure as hell wouldn’t care about the structure and functionality of my jaw and its relation to my dental health if I was into the booze. I wouldn’t care about anything. It’s the uncertainty that accompanies my boundless curiosity that I find to be one of the more beautiful things about sobriety. When I’m drinking I know exactly what to expect. The parameters of my day, of my life, are set. They are determined by the mind numbing routine of it all. But my mind wanders freely when sober, almost always surprising me with where it goes and what it finds. I mean, c’mon. Mewing?  

Has sobriety gifted you with anything you never thought you’d find yourself preoccupied by or fascinated with? What's something surprising that sober you has gotten up to?

I work somewhat long hours and rarely go out on Mondays. I have a chiller day today and want to get out with my girlfriend, but on a Monday evening I can't think of much besides going out to dinner.

I'm in Cobble Hill but can get anywhere (and also have a car). Any ideas on something cool to do that isn't going to a restaurant or bar and that would be open on a monday evening (I'm guessing this precludes most museums)?

Ok so basically my husband and I are getting married later this year. Each of our sides of the family are fairly big. It will be around 100-150 people total. My husband and I are paying for this all ourselves, as well as my grandma who said she doesn't care one way or the other on this issue. She just loves weddings.

We have a lot of kids in our family so we decided against making it child-free but we did decide to make it dry. So there will be no alcohol of any kind at our wedding. Honestly, this doesn't have anything to do with there being kids there but due to the fact that my fiancé and I don't drink. Nothing against people who do, it's just not for us and we don't want to. On top of that, we only really drink water. We rarely, if ever, drink soda so most of the time it's only water with the occasional juice and milk. We don't even drink coffee. 

So obviously the food (which is a part my grandma is not paying for) is going to be expensive for that many people. We are having our wedding catered so everyone will have a good choice of food to choose from but to drink only water will be provided. We don't want to have to pay for alcohol or soda, it is just an large added expense when we can just do filtered water for a MUCH cheaper cost.

Well, when family and friends found out being got angry. Some didn't really care but some are really upset about it. Saying that I can just have an open bar so I don't have to pay for drinks (we could, but still have to pay for the bartender and we just really don't want to bother with alcohol there). Or we should at least have soda because how can we expect everyone to drink ONLY water? The kids will be upset. The wedding will be boring. That this is not how weddings work. Etc.

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Let's get physical. I wanna get physical.

Well it's that time of year again, the time where I decide I better start moving and getting my body in some kind of respectable shape after months of the sedentary life. I'm not much of a year round exerciser but I really admire those who are. I'm more of a 0 to 100 person. Actually this is kind of an early start for me. Usually i don't get my stuff together until around mid-May. But the weather has been so nice here that it has been difficult not to get out.

I really enjoy walking. I tell everyone that walking is actually a superior form of exercise than running because if you speed walk your feet and legs are working twice as hard since there's less strides. I have no idea if this is true. I just really dislike running because I've never been any good at it. I don't understand pacing. and I'm 6'5 with unusually long legs so it can hurt after a bit. I do love basketball and shooting hoop though. Get a little HIIT. I've become somewhat obsessed with improving my circulation. I think it's due to this quit smoking app I use that tells me the percentage it has improved since I stopped, but I'm entirely unsure how they get those numbers. But unfortunately I'm prone to migraine headaches so I can't go too hard on the court. There's nothing quite like shooting hoops while the sun sets though. So i'll mostly stick to my speed walking, hitting the hills to feel that deep burn while praying I don't get attacked by some random dog off their leash (a genuine fear of mine). 

I don't know if it's because I'm getting older or if I just don't care as much anymore but I don't quite have the motivation I used to. So I'm hoping you will inspire me with all your sober triumphs in the gym and beyond. I kind of let the last two summers go by without getting out in them. Which is a real regret of mine because I do have a sense of time running out on this sort of thing, particularly the basketball. But I've solved the video gaming issue and I'm ready to get back to the activities I love. Here I come world! I will not let the summer of my 41st year go to waste. 

What are/have you been getting up to? Any ambitious exercise goals? Let hear your body talk!

I cannot believe my last day of hosting the DCI is finally here. I am so grateful to this community and to all of you beautiful people who have checked in with me every day to share your journeys with the rest of us. Some of you have really touched me in ways that I will carry with me for a long time, so I want to thank all of you from the bottom of my heart.  

I also want to take a second to thank the mods of /r/stopdrinking and /u/SaintHomer specifically for facilitating this and walking me through how everything works. It is a hard job to moderate a place this big, and we are all so fortunate to have them. Thank you, thank you, thank you!   

This week we got to cover some really important topics that have helped me immensely in my sobriety. We've discussed: Patience, Honesty, Community, Emotions &amp; Thoughts, Service, and Love.  

For my last post hosting the DCI, I want to talk about perhaps the most important thing I've been working on: **Gratitude**.  

I have not had an easy life in many ways. I experienced quite a bit of abuse and trauma as a young kid and it has had a huge impact on my life. Now I find myself in my late 30s, getting divorced and getting sober. Many days I've found myself wallowing in self pity, pain, anger, resentment and sadness. I've focused on everything that's wrong and difficult, and it was a painful place to be.  

One time in a meeting with my sponsor, he could tell I was feeling down and he asked me how I was doing. I laid out a laundry list of everything that was bothering me and he listened patiently, nodding along, but not saying anything. When I was finished, he leaned forward and said ""I want you to make a gratitude list.""   

I was a little annoyed, because I'd just told him all of the awful things that were going on in my head and there he was asking me to write down what I was grateful for.  

He said it can be anything. Some days I'm thankful that I hear a bird chirping outside. Some days I'm thankful for a joke I heard. Think about things that are big and small.  

So I have started doing this as often as I can. I like to do it every day, if possible. It's really interesting, because no matter how I feel before I start making my list, I always feel so much better when I'm done. It turns out, even though I haven't had an easy life, I'm so lucky for the life that I do have. And as I focus more and more on what I'm grateful for and less and less on what I'm resentful of, I start to see life in a new light. I start to realize how amazing it is that I'm actually here.   

So I wanted to close with something fairly vulnerable and personal. I hope it's okay and that it can inspire you all to think about doing something similar today and in the days ahead.   

**My gratitude list for today:**   

I'm grateful for...

- My health  
- This incredible community  
- All of the people I've been able to talk to and meet this week  
- The things I've learned talking to people this week  
- The smell of the trees and flowers outside after it rains  
- My stinky little dog who loves me so much   
- My family who support me through this difficult time in life  
- Sports. I love sports so much. Hockey playoffs are here! Baseball season is going!   
- My friends who I love so much. I've been asked to be a best man not once, but TWICE this year!   
- This second chance at life that sobriety has given me   
- The love I'm opening myself up to in the world  
- The sound that rain makes on the windshield of my car and the windows of my home. I don't know why, but I like it.  
- My job that provides me with health care and income so I can be safe and housed and fed  
- The hope I've discovered for the future. I had no hope when I was drinking.    
- The way the sun feels on my skin    
- The ocean and the beach  
- The mountains and the snow  
- The sleep I can get now that I'm sober  
- The patience and calm that I never had before  
- My sponsor and the many friends I've made in AA who have helped me so much   
- And finally I'm grateful to the universe for, in the unlikeliest of circumstances, showing me what true love and understanding really is. I have lived my life in black and white for decades. I can finally see in color, and I want to do that every second of every day for the rest of my life.   

Thank you all for sharing small parts of your lives with me this week as we all commit to the next 24 hours of sobriety together. This place and the people in it have saved my life over and over, and I'll never be able to pay that back.    

If you're reading this, thank you for being here. This random guy in California loves you, is rooting for you, and believes in you.

Hi everyone, I’m EffortCareless. It’s great to be hosting again.  I’m more than a little surprised to be back. My last relapse was pretty gnarly and I feel like I crawled out of the depths of hell. So I definitely consider myself fortunate to be here with you.  

I’m going to keep this one short as I’m feeling quite ill at the moment. Something violent just rushed over me this morning, leaving me flat and achy. Which is strange because I read this piece on a journalist who suddenly became sick and died several days later.  I mean, what are the odds right? Surely it’s just a coincidence.  

Anyway, I wanted to continue the discussion on gratitude that u/leftpointsonly started yesterday (superb job hosting by the way). Awhile back I was lucky enough to catch the documentary Stutz on Netflix. The film looks at some of the major techniques developed by Phil Stutz, a renowned psychiatrist who has a helpful book entitled Tools, or something like that I can’t remember.  I’m pretty sure it’s called Tools. The actor Jonah Hill, a patient of Stutz, sat down with the psychiatrist to discuss his ideas. The two share a wonderful relationship with great chemistry and it was a joy to see them work through the nature of that dynamic. And I really admired Jonah’s vulnerability, particularly when he spoke about his secret self, that part of us that Stutz claims we have disavowed and hidden away because we are ashamed and embarrassed by them (seriously, this will break your heart).  

One tool is called the grateful flow. Stutz asked Hill to close his eyes and think about what he was grateful for. And then he asked him to keep going, to slowly dig deeper. The objective here is to keep getting smaller and smaller in the things you are grateful for, to work and think hard about what brings you joy. This creative process fosters what Stutz calls a stream of gratitude that if practiced enough can vanquish the anxiety, angst, and despair that can lead to all sorts of troublesome behaviors. But what I found especially interesting and beneficial was the concept of sitting with your gratitude. After Jonah made his gratitude list he was told to stop naming things and just feel the force created by his gratefulness. This allows for a kind of embodiment of one’s gratitude. It takes you over and with enough practice gratitude becomes a state of mind that can be immediately invoked whenever those nasty, intrusive thoughts arise.   

Practicing the grateful flow has been remarkably helpful in getting and staying sober. I like that it diverts my attention away from all the bad stuff in my head and makes me focus on what I’m happy about (who knew I was so thankful for lemon poppyseed muffins?). The list changes every time and I’m often surprised by the things I name when performing the exercise. Like Jonah, I feel a kind of warmth and comfort when sitting with my gratitude. It can be quite serene if I let myself get lost in it for a few minutes. It’s hard for me to want to drink when I’m that content. I encourage you all to try it out and enter the flow!

Thank you for all the kind and encouraging words of support yesterday. I’m feeling better today, so much so that I was able to take my boys to a monster truck rally that they’d been looking forward to for months. I was pretty scared I’d be unable to go and really didn’t want to disappoint them. It was interesting, to say the least. There’s perhaps nothing more foreign to my sensibility than a monster truck show. I did find it incredible how many people were walking around with $10 cans of beers. Even at my worst I think I’d hold out for a couple of hours (I could be a real stingy bastard). Of course, I did spend $15 on two lemonades so who am I to judge?  

About three years ago I embarked on a journey of self-discovery that roughly coincided with my decision to take sobriety seriously for the first time. My life was a real mess at the time. Burnt bridges everywhere I looked. Estrangement from most of my family and strained relationships with those whom I still spoke to. If I once had a moral compass, it had broken long ago, leaving only my insatiable appetites and desires to guide me. Once the fog caused by my abuse of alcohol lifted I could see myself with greater clarity. And I didn’t like what I saw when I looked inward. I decided that I had no time to waste on anymore self-discovery. I needed self-annihilation. I needed to hit the reset button and start over from scratch.  

I enlisted the help of a therapist (my own Stutz, seriously love the guy). We worked on overcoming my rampant narcissism that led me to selfishly and single-mindedly pursue all forms of pleasure, whatever the consequences. Actually, I don’t think I ever understood that there were such things as consequences for my behavior. I just assumed someone else would clean up my messes. My new self I was fashioning therefore had to adhere to a firm set of values that could help me to live more ethically and conscientiously. Without the haze of alcohol obstructing my vision, I finally began to understand what truly mattered. For the first time since they were born, I began engaging my children in meaningful ways. Everything I had been obsessed with in the past—alcohol, sex, pills, status, material possessions—lost their luster as I found a renewed sense of purpose. And all it required was a complete self-renovation! Even when I relapse I continue to live out my values that I worked so hard to instill and embody. Perhaps that’s why I feel so awful when I do slip—I'm too self-aware now to not care if I’m drinking my life away.  

One of the tools I’ve found instrumental for reinventing myself is Reddit. I love Reddit. Absolutely and unapologetically love it. I’m willing to bet my browsing amounts to around 80% of my phone screentime.  For me, Reddit is the platform of NO. Obviously there’s stopdrinking. But I also frequent stopsmoking (I’m on day 38 of no smokes!). Then there’s stopgaming. Oh, and nobuy and Anticonsumption. Hell, there’s even a stoplacroix sub. But in addition to stopdrinking, the sub that has been most helpful in reimagining my life has been simpleliving. The two are actually quite complimentary and I’ve found many members of simpleliving  are recovering alcoholics. It’s a great resource for learning how to slow down and appreciate a calmer, still life. One of the questions I see often asked on this sub is “what the hell do I do with all my time now that I can’t drink?” Well come on down to simpleliving and you’ll find more ideas than you’ll know what to do with. I realy do love Reddit. Now that I think about it, it’s a bit ironic that I’m addressing my various addictions by developing another addiction. I wonder if there’s a stopreddit? I bet there is. 

How about you? What have you had the opportunity to change about yourself after giving up the booze? How did you do it? Or what would you like to change?

It’s been such an exciting week hosting the DCI, I’m sad that it’s almost over. Thank you to everyone that’s followed along, checked in, contributed and reached out.  

So far this week we’ve discussed some topics that have really helped me in my sobriety: Patience, Honesty, Community, Emotions &amp; Thoughts, and Service.  

Today I’d like to talk about: **Love**.  

As so many of us have discussed, isolation is a massive part of our addiction. We close ourselves off either intentionally or unintentionally from those around us as we slip deeper into our drinking.  

Something I started to realize is that if isolation and separation from people is part of addiction, then the opposite must be part of recovery.  

My whole life I have been judgmental, quiet, standoffish, and closed off. I closed myself off to protect myself, and when people naturally didn’t want to be with me because of it, I could justify it as ok, because I had already judged those people. Sort of a “you can’t fire me, I quit” mentality.   

When I was drinking, that was fine. I was in my little bubble and I didn’t need anybody. I had everything I needed in my glass.  

As I’ve started to get more time under my belt I’ve begun feeling like a huge part of my life was missing, and it didn’t take long to realize that I was yearning for love and connection.  

It’s one reason I’m getting divorced. My relationship was based on two drinkers enabling one another, not love. As I’ve chosen sobriety I’ve realized that without love, the relationship no longer works.  

But more than that, I realized I had separated from family, friends, community and the world. I was living completely without love and connection. I was floating day to day on a lazy river between the times that I drank.  

It has been a painful thing to come to terms with. It was one of the many things I was numbing with alcohol, and it was one of the many things that alcohol had caused.  

I have been using these early days of sobriety to do something I’ve never done before, and that’s open myself up to love. I want to be seen and I want to be loved, and even though it is so scary for me, I am allowing myself to be loved and appreciated by not only the people that already knew me, but by new people too.   

It is overwhelming in the best way.   

The hole that I was trying, and failing, to fill with alcohol is running over with love from my friends and family as well as new love that’s blossoming. I’ve never let myself be this open before and it’s changed everything.  

I want to challenge myself to continue loving and allowing myself to be loved.  

Simple things like talking with new people can achieve this. Opening yourself up to new experiences. Allowing for the possibility that kindness, friendship and love do exist if we let them. These things don’t come easy to all of us. But when we put ourselves out there with open hearts, the love that can come back can be more powerful than any drink ever will be.

The only thing that made sense was that someone had shit themself. Throughout the party, I tried to discreetly find the source of the smell. My grandma made sense, because she's 93. I asked her if she was tired and wanted to go home, and she said she was fine. It wasn't her. I walked around, smelling, but couldn't pinpoint the source of the smell.

I smelled my clothes and was horrified to learn it was myself. Especially horrified because we had guests over who we need to make a good impression, for my daughter's sake. I changed my clothes.

The smell didn't go away. I then realized what it was. This is what I deduced:

A month before the party, I got a tooth pulled, and it made a hole all the way to my sinus. The dentist gave me antibiotics and lots of instructions to follow. One of which was to not use a straw to drink. A week later, I drank with a straw. That interrupted the healing process, and the hole persisted for longer than the antibiotic course. Then it got infected.

This is the US, and we're in a small town, so the medical care isn't what you'd call top notch, and appointments are slow. Months in between. Here's the medical timeline:

1. First doctor gave me another course of antibiotics. The smell didn't go away.

2. Second doctor told me it was rhinitis, and to take flonase. I started to think it was all in my head, until I blew my nose in the car, and my wife thought the baby needed a change.

3. The smell got so bad, I went to an urgent care center. That doctor took a culture sample by having me blow my nose onto a q-tip. The culture came back negative, so I was referred to get a CT scan, and see an ENT.

4. Got the CT scan. It cost me $750 after insurance.

5. Follow-up dentist appointment. This was several months late because the office kept postponing my appointment, due to people quitting, snow, etc. Their X-ray didn't show anything. They just said to go see the ENT.

6. The ENT said that blowing my nose onto a q-tip is not proper procedure. He took a sample by putting something deep into my nose. He also has a CT scan machine in his office, and said it would have cost me $150 if I did it there. He said the place I got my scan and the urgent care center are owned by the same company, so that's why they sent me there instead of to him.

Now, it's 7 months after this all started. I'm waiting for the next ENT appointment, where he is going to expand my nasal cavity with a baloon, and then suck up all the bacteria with a vacuum.

TL;DR: If you have a hole from your mouth to your sinus, carefully do everything the dentist says! Otherwise you may end up having to blow your nose every 10 minutes, and smelling shit for 6 months.",t2_aex6wpi5q,"TIFU by drinking through a straw, and now everything smells like shit.",t3_1356aml,1356aml,throwaway1952711451,151,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1356aml/tifu_by_drinking_through_a_straw_and_now/,0.96,904,drinking,0.1710477918386459,0.0241210088133811,0.4219823777675628,0.0497943498194217,0.0553071610629558,0.1620669066905975,0.0244331862777471,0.0344941429793834,0.0410326942801475,0.0157204195857048,0.9153959155082703,0.08460406213998795

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

When I first decided to try to get sober this year, I was going to try to do it the same way I'd tried a million times before - by going it alone and doing it without anybody knowing about it. If people asked I'd just shrug and say I was taking a few days off. When you tell people you're sober it invites a lot of questions, and I didn't feel like answering them.  

The one thing I did differently this time was I told my therapist. He's known me for over a decade and he nodded and listened, and then he said something that probably changed my life forever.  

""I've known a lot of people who have gone through this. None of them have been able to do it alone.""   

*""Except for me...""* I thought to myself. I'll be the exception to the rule. I'm smart, I can do this. I don't need help.   

Then I started thinking about it. How I'd tried to do it alone many times before. And how this man has saved my life time and time again and he's way older and way wiser, and maybe he knows what he's talking about...   

And so I told one of my oldest friends I had a drinking problem. He hugged me, I cried, and he asked me to be his best man at his wedding.  

And then I told another one of my oldest friends and he hugged me, I cried, and he told me he would always be there for me.   

I told my sister and she couldn't have been more amazing. So kind and loving and supportive, like she always is. I cried some more.  

I told my parents. Then I started telling everyone I knew.  

And I joined AA. Now, I know some of you are in the program, some aren't, some hate it, some prefer other methods. I'm not endorsing it whatsoever. What I do know for certain, though, is that this is not something any of us can do alone. Just by being here we are participating in something that is essential to the human experience and essential to healing and sobriety. We are participating in community.  

Whatever that looks like for you, share this challenge and journey with people who care about you and want to support you. If that's AA or another recovery program, great. If that's friends and family, great. If it's SD or another online community, great. If it's all of the above or a mix of these, even better.  

A hallmark of addiction is isolation. We feel like we have to go it alone, when we really don't. We are surrounded at all times by people who are ready and willing to show us love, lift us up, and support us.   

We just have to show up and take that first step.

Family just sat me down because I came home drunk last night and they are worried about my drinking. One of my family members works on post with BH and says that me getting drunk on the weekends is not acceptable because ""you're a soldier 24/7"".

I am an officer, still pretty young and inexperienced, but I didn't think drinking on my own time on the weekends was a big deal. It's never affected my work or ability to do my job, but I do drink maybe a quarter of a handle when I do drink. If I were to get a random call back on a Saturday night I would definitely not be able to come in. 

Will admit that the last 2 yrs in the army have been rough, personally and professionally, and that me wanting to drink is definitely because of that. But is this all an overreaction? Is the standard different for officers? I just keep it to the weekends. Most of my peer group definitely drinks a lot more than I do and it hasn't affected them professionally at all.

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I can't believe I'm already on my 5th day hosting the DCI. I've wanted to do this for such a long time and it has been so fun and helpful to my sobriety to connect with so many of you amazing people in this community.    

Each day I've been sharing on a topic that has helped me in my sobriety so far. We've talked about Patience, Honesty, Community and Emotions &amp; Thoughts.    

Today I thought we could touch on something I'm just starting to dip my toe in to: **Service**.    

When I first started going to meetings I kept hearing people end their commitments with ""thank you for letting me be of service."" I figured it was some AA ritual thing that I didn't understand yet and I mostly ignored it.    

As time went on I started realizing that every meeting came with service work. Some people greeted, some stayed after to clean up, some cleaned the bathrooms or served coffee. Some simply just helped distribute chips or read to the group.    

And then of course people also raised their hands to volunteer as sponsors.    

I'm an introvert by nature. And when I first started going to meetings I sat in the back, kept my head down, and didn't talk to anyone that didn't talk to me first. One time after someone shared that they didn't have any self esteem an old timer suggested, ""you want some self esteem? Do some estimable acts.""    

That's when it clicked for me. Being of service, big or small, is something we can be proud of. It connects us to other people. It helps those that need help. It might be making coffee, or it might be helping an old lady carry her groceries. It might be sobriety related like volunteering your time, and it might be simply connecting with another person out in the world that needs help. The point is to get out of ourselves and do something good for another person who could use some kindness and assistance.    

If you're rolling your eyes at the idea of doing something selfless, hear me out. Helping people improves our mood. It literally raises our dopamine levels. It makes us proud of ourselves, and will usually get us out of our own heads. As so many of us have discussed, addiction often leads to isolation. Service is an incredible way to get us out of ourselves while also doing some good in the world. It can be for purely selfish reasons if you'd like, it doesn't really matter. The fact is that being of service to someone else will make you feel better about yourself.   

Think about what something like that might have meant to you when you were at your lowest point. There are probably folks who are struggling very badly right now reading this. Imagine if someone you didn't know in the middle of your day took just a minute to be kind and help you. It would probably have a profound impact.    

*""Everyone you meet is fighting a battle you know nothing about. Be kind. Always.""*    

You can help yourself and help another person at the same time. There's a saying about calling another alcoholic (you don't have to use that term, I happen to for myself). They say every call saves two lives. Yours and theirs.    

On the note of service, if anyone here with 30 days or more of sobriety would like to volunteer to host the Daily Check In thread for a week, please let the incredible /u/SaintHomer know! It's really fun, you get to talk to so many incredible people, and you get to be of service to this amazing community.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Thank you to everyone who has been participating in the DCI this week, I'm having a blast and am so glad to see so much discussion taking place. So far I've posted about a few things that have been key in my sobriety: Patience, Honesty and Community.  

Today I want to talk about **Emotions and Thoughts**.  

If you're anything like me, a huge part of why you drank was to numb your painful emotions and difficult thoughts. For the longest time I didn't realize that that's what I was doing. I would pour myself a drink, and then another, and then another, every single evening, and tell myself I was just doing it to relax.  

It took me a while to realize what I was actually doing was warding off the difficult emotions and thoughts that often came up at night. It dawned on my slowly in the middle of last year when I started noticing that every evening I didn't drink, I was sad and just wanted to go to bed, and every evening I did drink, I felt happy and care free.  

One of the hardest parts of my sober journey so far has been reckoning with those difficult emotions and thoughts when they come up, and as I heal from chronic alcohol abuse, they come up a lot.  

After I made it through the first week and a half of withdrawal, I started to even out, and those thoughts and emotions became way less intense. This community got me through that period, and I'll never be able to thank the people who showed up to offer advice and kindness as I emerged from that dark pit.  

It's a scary feeling in early sobriety going from the pink cloud to crying and feeling absolutely isolated and lonely. Sometimes in the same day. Self doubt, panic, fear, and all of those fun things that I was keeping at bay with alcohol started to creep out of the woodwork to pay a visit.  

Part of the challenge now is being able to internalize this truth: Emotions and thoughts aren't facts, they will pass, and I'll be okay.  

But man, that can be hard sometimes.   

How many times have we all thought ""I just can't make it another day like this. Fuck it, I'll drink.""?  

For so long, for so many of us, those feelings and thoughts became too heavy and we cracked and drank. So many of us drink AT our emotions and thoughts. Our insecurities, our fears, our pain, our trauma, our memories, our anger, our shame. We drink directly AT them, because it's too much to face them.   

To me, one of the parts of not just quitting drinking but living life sober is learning to face those emotions and thoughts without the need to numb myself. Or even do anything at all.  

It is a difficult, daily, sometimes hourly, exercise that I'm sure I'll be working on for the rest of my life. But, I finally have a life. I'm living instead of floating through a haze day after day.  It's so worth it, and I'm dedicated to putting more time together, one day at a time.  

How have you learned to deal with your emotions and thoughts now that you don't have alcohol to numb them? How has that changed over time as you've put more sober time together?",t2_sn2zt6ss,"The Daily Check-In for Wednesday, April 12th: Just for today, I am NOT drinking!",t3_12ja62a,12ja62a,leftpointsonly,818,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/12ja62a/the_daily_checkin_for_wednesday_april_12th_just/,0.99,413,drinking,0.1016659811139106,0.0125296181067824,0.0662782117724418,0.0454122461378574,0.0703391134738922,0.4036957919597626,0.0202149655669927,0.141307845711708,0.0975166410207748,0.0410395972430706,0.3215707540512085,0.6784291863441467

I made it through the last 30 days without drinking once. I am so proud of myself. The cravings and urges have gone down, they’re not entirely gone by any means but more so a minor distraction now than anything. My depression and anxiety are almost non existent, it’s crazy. I wish I had stuck to not drinking when I went 3 months without drinking last year. I never want to go back to the dark place that alcohol takes me. Here’s to another day of NOT drinking. IWNDWYT!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Thank you to all of the amazing people who took the time to check in on the DCI yesterday. There were so many incredible comments and perspectives about the first topic I proposed: Patience. I'm so thankful to be doing this with all of you.  

Today I wanted to talk about another tool that has been so central to my recovery so far: **Honesty**.  

Every time I've tried to quit drinking in the past, I've tried to do it alone. I've tried to keep it a secret so that I could fix it by myself and nobody in my life would have to know how bad it had gotten. Unsurprisingly, I failed every time.  

I used to think I was keeping it a secret because if I told people, then they'd hold me accountable. I constantly asked myself if I was making too much of this whole ""drinking problem"" thing that was bouncing around in my head, usually as I nursed a hangover on a random week day. I second guessed myself for years, even though I knew deep down that I had a problem.   

What I've come to realize is that I wasn't keeping it a secret from my friends and family because I was worried about being held accountable by them, but because I wasn't willing to be honest with myself.   

_""The deception of others is nearly always rooted in the deceptions of ourselves.""_  

I lied about why I didn't show up on time. Why I was sweating. Why I was so tired. Why I was sick. Why I was so anxious. I hid bottles at the bottom of the recycling bin. I didn't make plans too early or too late. I was lying to people because I was lying to myself.  

I could not admit to myself that I really had a problem. So I lied to everyone, and I lied to myself.  

The other day a sober friend told me that if his kids or his wife opened up his phone it wouldn't bother him. He had nothing to hide. He said he had a boring, honest life. No secrets. No bottles stashed anywhere or hidden in a bag at the bottom of the trash. Honest.   

That's truly why I'm getting sober. I want to live an honest life. I want to have a family some day, and I want them to know that dad will do what he says, tells the truth, is dependable, loves them, and works hard. I want to be a boring, hard working, sober dad.  

And it all starts with my willingness to be truly honest with myself.   

So my question for today - how has honesty helped you in your recovery, and how can you continue to practice honesty to aid you in your sobriety?",t2_sn2zt6ss,"The Daily Check-In for Monday, April 10th: Just for today, I am NOT drinking!",t3_12h6pzz,12h6pzz,leftpointsonly,803,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/12h6pzz/the_daily_checkin_for_monday_april_10th_just_for/,0.99,301,drinking,0.1013326793909072,0.0130189135670661,0.0690976083278656,0.045771274715662,0.0711294263601303,0.392496794462204,0.0217155404388904,0.1408304274082183,0.1025985702872276,0.0420087501406669,0.31849491596221924,0.6815050840377808

It's Saturday my friends. My last day getting to host this amazing check-in with amazing people. While I sit here snuggled under the covers, exhausted from the day and looking forward to some great sleep, I'm so incredibly grateful for this opportunity. I feel so lucky to have found this slice of goodness. Each of your replies and up votes and encouragement to each other, every single day. Literal hundreds, I'm in absolute awe of the power of this collective group of sober strangers.

Today's theme song: *""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" by The Beatles:

""I look at the world, and I notices it's turning. While my guitar gently weeps. With every mistake, we must surely be learning. Still my guitar gently weeps.""

""I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping. While my guitar gently weeps.""

My world is turning. I showed up today for my friend. Nurturing, joyful, caring, funny. And confident. I was focused on what I knew. We were eating burgers and fries, playing cards, and I told her how much I love her. I don't know that I would have been able  to carry myself the same way had I been drinking. Honestly, I probably would have had a drink or two before I went to calm my nerves. I'm noticing tonight as I reflect, the confidence piece is what I'm most proud of. This is the feeling that I've chased the most in using alcohol, the ability to be confident and steady in an awkward situation. Well you know what booze honey babe, I have this a whole lot stronger without you. And I found I realized it as just the right time, to gift to my friend when she needs it's strength the most. 

I'm 5 days from 3 months sober. I came here on day one when I was hung over, full of anxiety and shame for driving in a black out for over an hour the night before. I was sitting at Panera, soaking my bread in broccoli cheddar soup, trying desperately to get rid of the spiny headache and nausea. I found this group from Sober Pal's IG and made my first post. I remember reading the first response, someone told me they were glad I was here. And then another person let me know, it's not forever, it's just for today. The support poured in and suddenly I wasn't alone.  

You all, the love, the support, the constant encouragement day in and day out. You've lifted and held me up so that I had the courage to gain these new sober super powers. Through any mistake shared here. For each day one, or day one again, post. Someone on here reads it, feels it, and whether they comment or not, sends out a chord of support. One of you brave souls reaches out with a melody of wisdom, than some understanding and cheerleading, joins in as the supporting harmony. All of a sudden, there is an orchestra of up votes and emojis and the vibrations pf the symphony echo through us all. 

This group is amazing. Each of you in it is incredible. You've been the support I needed to thrive in this sobriety journey. I thank you all, from the bottom of my big weepy heart and soul, for showing up for yourselves, and each other, each day.

Holy Moly! What an absolute gift it is to read the words of you wonderfully, fabulous, and kind strangers.  I'm so grateful to each of you for your brave vulnerability. Where ever you are in your days; from day 1 to 1000, you inspire me. 

SO MANY MUSIC RECOMMENDATIONS. I am stoked for new tunes. End of the week I think I'll make a separate post just to have a thread of shared music that everyone can reference if they'd like to. I know it can be challenging to read through all the posts on a Daily thread. 

Tuesday. This was usually the day in the week I really started to plan and scheme when my real drinking would be on for the week. You know, the let loose kind where I don't stop at 3 or 4 or 5 and then go to bed. The kind where you pregame and get dolled up and take shots. Thirsty Thursday Happy Hour? Stay for 5 hours? You betcha! I'm young, I work downtown, I am living the life!  

Today's theme song is: \*My Own Worst Enemy\* by Lit

""Can we forget about the things I said when I was drunk? I didn't mean to call you that. I can't remember what was said or what you threw at me. Please tell me. Please tell me why, my car is in the front yard. And I'm sleeping with my clothes on. I came in through the window last night. And you're long gone, gone.""

Do you know how cool I used to think I was that I'd done everything in this song without remembering? I'd achieved my high school anthem! For most of the 20 years of my drinking that started at 14, I convinced myself it was what everyone does. It's the cool thing. Everyone blacks out and does stupid shit. It's true that it is mainstream and marketed in our faces everywhere. But, I started to slowly see that it was often just me going so hard I'd fall over, pass out, or any number of cringey ""so drunk I"" fill in the blank. Sure, I hung out with lots of drinkers. But I was the one waking up with TP wrapped around my knees and elbows from their drunk version of nursing me after one of my falls. I was the one not reminiscing about the night before at the cafe or brunch or at work the next day. Instead I was the one quietly, nervously listening. Waiting for the inevitable story of what I did, and don't have any recollection of. 

Reading the lyrics, forcing myself not to sing them. It's like a day after drinking and blacking out voicemail that I'm leaving on the phone of someone I care about, who is fed up with my drunk behavior. It's not actually a cool, feel good feeling. I actually felt like a low life. The day after I partied I didn't recognize myself, or remember myself for that matter. 

Creeping up to 90 days, I'm more clear minded than I've been in 20 years. I can see clearly now (oops song lyrics) how this convincing and rationalizing was in fact, my addiction talking. I've been listening to my addiction tell me ""screw it, what's one more night"" for so long, I thought that's just what life was about; giving up. Now that I am not under the haze of being drunk or hungover or anxious from withdrawing, I can really see what it is I want for my life. I want my words and actions to be a reflection of who I am. All the time. Every day. I want to be the best version of myself, be my own best friend. And honestly, I won't be me if I'm drunk and I can never have just one drink. 

Screw being our own enemies. Let's be our own best comrades, allies, mates.",t2_vjc80vrj,"The Daily Check-In for Tuesday, April 4th: Just for today, I am NOT drinking!",t3_12b8i0j,12b8i0j,DesiringSobriety,873,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/12b8i0j/the_daily_checkin_for_tuesday_april_4th_just_for/,0.99,490,drinking,0.1033013686537742,0.0126124480739235,0.0691671893000602,0.0462273322045803,0.070344902575016,0.3946598768234253,0.0206448882818222,0.1408605575561523,0.1007256433367729,0.0414558425545692,0.31803494691848755,0.6819650530815125

I wish I had as much time today as yesterday to read all of the replies. I can literally feel my heart swelling with love and gratitude. Kinda like the Grinch when his heart is growing too big for his chest? ~~Sorry~~ Big ol feeling all the feels softy over here. And I'm actually not going to apologize for it!

At my SMART meeting tonight someone shared they are going to the Red Hot Chili Peppers and The Strokes this week. One, I'm incredibly jealous. I absolutely love The Strokes. Two, I was so tickled this musical theme is making it's way into my other sober support space! 

Today's theme song: \*Animal\* by Miike Snow

Honestly, the whole song. Each line brings up something different. But here's the two that at this moment, really speak to me. (It's also super upbeat and a great mood booster when you need a little)

""In your eyes I see the eyes of somebody I knew before, long, long, long ago. But I'm still trying to make my mind up. Am I free of am I tied up?""

""I change shapes just to hide in this place But I'm still, I'm still an animal. Nobody knows it but me when I slip, yeah I slip, I'm still an animal.""

The first lyrics remind me of the agony of deciding and undeciding than redeciding to stop drinking. I'd have these very conscious moments, reality checks with myself. I've really only ever journaled in my life when I'm struggling with drinking. The next time I'd open to journal, I'd reread the last entry from a year or two prior. There was a recognition, a spark of hope for change paired simultaneously with a fear of failure. A fear of what it means to be that person who can't control their drinking. Am I care free because I can let lose with liquid courage? Or am I tied up by an addiction? Am I free from the weight and monotony of life revolved around the drink? Or am I tied up by the inability to imbibe at a special occasion? 

The second lyric is a sturdy reminder for me that I am indeed, still an animal. I struggle with cravings and triggers. I don't want to obsess, but I want to stay vigilant and aware to when those intrusive thoughts make their way in. My dirty little alcohol brain is finding ways to change shapes and tempt me in new ways. This weekend the vacuum clogged up and I spent 30 minutes trying to get it to function. When my husband didn't think now was the time to focus on it, I got pissy. Indignant. About a vacuum, I know. But I was upset. All of a sudden that sneaky little bugger voice tried to convince me that it was Saturday. Why spend it pissed about a vacuum? Why not pop open that bottle of raspberry chocolate port from your wedding. Surely hubby wouldn't want to never be able to drink one of the wines from your wedding ever again. WAIT WHAT!? How did we get here? Over a clogged vacuum. I seriously considered drinking it. Sneaking it in the bathroom, he would never know. But then, the other voice in me had a reminder; that I would know. Even if he never noticed, I would know. 

I'm finally learning that I'm the free spirit I want to be when I'm free from the life revolved alcohol. Free from the anxiety surrounding it. I'm also finally learning that being accountable to myself is the highest form of self respect. As you can tell from Monday and yesterday, I'm really loving getting reacquainted with and becoming best friends with myself. That friendship is getting grounded in honesty and respect, and I AM HERE FOR IT.

My husband (33) and myself (31) always have an awkward stand off when it comes to the alcohol situation. He is not LDS, but is incredibly (overly) sensitive to the fact that his family does not drink. He admittedly has said that he tends to way over analyze these situations. I have always presented myself as honest with them, and really don’t hide any part of our secular life. His mom and sister, and brother in-law have made it abundantly clear that they know we drink and that they do not care. At our wedding we had alcohol, and drank in front of them and it was not awkward at all. I think it’s unfair to have to restrict ourselves on vacation. We’re using PTO, and planning on paying for the alcohol ourselves so personally I don’t think it’s a big deal.

For fountains I would put my mouth over the stream and try to sip it, but it would take forever to get enough. Apparently you’re supposed to tilt your head sideways and let it fall into your mouth.

For straws I would put the opening between my lips and teeth instead of past my teeth, which is how everyone does it I guess so your teeth don’t get cold.

But onto my question, for drinking out of cups I let the water reach my lips and then I kinda suck it into my mouth, but now after all this I’m wondering if you’re supposed to just let it flow into your mouth then swallow? How are you supposed to do that without also swallowing air? Am I a moron?

Idk if I have some sort of trauma surrounding water before from I can remember, or it’s just that no one specifically taught me how to do these things, and my way has worked well enough for 20 years?

Anyway. Please help lol

EDIT: I really don’t think my boyfriend is gaslighting me like some are suggesting, I might’ve worded it poorly but he’s completely playful and joking, not genuinely criticizing.

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

It's Friday sober friends. For those that have a traditional work week, you're made it! To those of us who work weekends, the madness may just be taking off. Wherever you are in your cycle of doing the stuff we have to do to make the green stuff to do the things we want to do, welcome to the day.

I'm sitting with a heavy heart honestly. One of my dearest friends is currently in the hospital. She has struggled for many years with depression, and her struggles turned into ideation that required medical intervention. She is in the right place and getting the support she needs. And, it's really difficult to love someone so much and not be able to fix or do anything to change their outlook. Her husband called today and invited me to visit her tomorrow. I'm nervous I won't say the right things, but I'm grateful to be able to share space and time with her.

To honor my friend today, I had to choose some Lilith Fair. Today's theme song: *""What's Up""* by 4 Non Blondes:

""And I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed, just to get it all out, what's in my head. And I, I am feeling a little peculiar. And so I wake in the morning and I step outside, I take a deep breath and I get real high. And I scream from the top of my lungs, what's going on?!""

Life is full of painful moments. Times where I'm just not sure I have the strength, the capacity as a wise friend here shared, to deal with it. The sadness is heavy on my chest and makes my heart race, ping ponging a hundred miles an hour between my lungs. This physical feeling was relatively infrequent before I chose sobriety. I've felt it more in the last 83 days than in the 2 years prior. Peculiar is a damn good way to describe it actually, because it's by all accounts, unusual.

But I'm more present and aware of this sadness. The physical reaction to the anxiety. The flush in my face when I'm upset. I'm actually FEELING. I guess this is what it's like to live life without numbing it out. It's often not great, heck that's why I avoided it by drink. But I am letting it out of my body. Not pushing it down, letting it build layers and burrow in deep.

While it's uncomfortable, on the other side is another peculiar feeling. A lightness across my neck and shoulders. It resembles the hour after a massage, when your muscles are fully extended in relaxation. In this state, I can breathe in more deeply. Soak in the highs of life a little more fully. A crisp breeze in a quiet morning full of birds chirping. The crackle of an evening fire, nestled under a soft and warm blanket.

It still catches me off guard, the last two days I felt quite anxious, thinking I'd had too much caffeine. Turns out, I've been ruminating these feelings about my friend. When I took the time to sit and pay attention to what was happening, it became more clear I'm having a physical reaction to the anxiety and pain of my friend's circumstances. I can't change what's happening or how I feel about it, but by changing my response, I find these painful moments less overwhelming in the long run.

I think I'll be doing a fair amount of screaming and singing today, getting out the spinning thoughts in my head.

Happy Monday Sober Friends. I'm a day late, but I'm here and excited to be hosting this week. I have to tell you that I've been pretty nervous about hosting for all you wonderful people. I know how important this group has been to my successful weeks in sobriety and it feels like a lot of pressure! But one thing that this alcohol free life is teaching me; I am capable of hard things. When I was drinking, the anxiety of screwing up would have stopped me from ever messaging an offer to host. And then screwing up the time zones and missing the first day? Forget it. I would have left this sub, and all of reddit for that matter since I only joined this platform for this group. The shame and guilt would have been too much. But now? I apologized for my honest mistake this morning and moved on, with excitement for tonight! (I'm in the states, CST, so this is technically Sunday night) It's freedom at its finest. 

Now for the hosting business! Music is a big part of my life. I use it to narrate the rollercoaster of life. This week, I'll be sharing a song each day with specific lyrics that mean something to me in my sobriety. I'd love to hear if the lyrics resonate with you. Or, if you have a song that supports you in your sobriety. 

First Up: \*Let No Grief\* by The Wild Reeds

""The seasons are changing and supposedly I have to as well. My heart is pacing and I have to break free from your spell. Now I have to sing something louder than I have before. So I can escape this overwhelming pain, and never hurt no more. ""

I heard this song for the first time when I was driving to a friend's house, dreading how I was going to tell a group of gals that I can't drink anymore because I don't know how to stop.  Serendipitous Spotify playlist suggestion. The second time the chorus played, I belted out through sobbing tears ""So I can escape this overwhelming pain, and never hurt no more."" I gripped my steering wheel and sang. For me, the pain of my drinking was finally too much. I'd lost friends and boyfriends and jobs and money. But more importantly, I'd lost respect for myself, confidence in my own skin, and hope that I could live life any differently. Yet again, I'd broken a promise to myself I wouldn't get too drunk. I would only have 2 glasses of wine. I couldn't trust myself anymore. I truly didn't think I could drink one more day without ending up in jail or hurt myself or someone I love. 

Supposedly. That word was key for me in this song. That is my drinking voice, she's sassy and rebellious. Rolling her eyes and telling me I'm giving in by giving up. Alcohol, for people like me, is a total spell. And I was finally ready to break free. 

Now when I listen to this song, I focus on the ""Now I have to sing something louder than I have before"" lyrics. It's my time now to get to know myself. Grow comfort and confidence in that being. Being sober, I realize how much of my personality, thoughts, jokes, and perspective I was hiding. I used to tell myself I couldn't be social or outgoing without alcohol. Actually, I am capable of doing those things sober. I may be nervous and shy, but the awkward anxiety is so much shorter lived and less intense than day after anxiety of being an absolute blubbering idiot. I rather like myself and all my quirks. I am a smart, and fun and nurturing person. 

If I could change one thing about the lyrics, it would be from I \*have\* to sing, to I \*get\* to sing. Today I \*get\* to do the hard things and  \*\*be loud and proud and I do them.\*\* So, what is something you get to do today? Or are proud to be doing louder than you were before? I hope you'll listen to this song today. In the shower or in your car perhaps so you can sing along and belt it out! Or do that on the train, and love yourself for it.",t2_vjc80vrj,"The Daily Check-In for Monday, April 3rd: Just for today, I am NOT drinking!",t3_12a908p,12a908p,DesiringSobriety,932,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/12a908p/the_daily_checkin_for_monday_april_3rd_just_for/,0.99,417,drinking,0.1025264412164688,0.0130600919947028,0.0694789960980415,0.0457955114543437,0.0713590160012245,0.391104131937027,0.0217768047004938,0.140650063753128,0.1021281704306602,0.0421207807958126,0.3134934604167938,0.6865065693855286

Hello again my dear sober friends. Tonight I met up with a set of friends I haven't seen since I've been sober. Last time we hung out, we went on a brewery bus tour. Responsibly ensuring no one drinks and drives, and ensuring that those of us without functioning stop buttons spend way too much money and don't remember past the second brewery. What a blast. Hubby and I picked a brewery that has NA on tap, but I was nervous about the moment they noticed and the inevitable conversation. Well, it turns out they wanted to meet up to share they were pregnant, so she was getting the NA too! My nerves subsided and I told her the truth. I like to start with I met my lifetime limit, sarcasm feels more light hearted to me. She didn't look at me weird or with judgment, she responded with ""well we can be non drinkers together!"" I love when life surprises me. Describing this all I realize because I wasn't in a state of stress, I then also wasn't obsessing or bothered by being around others drinking!

Today's theme song: *""Don't Think Twice, It's All Right""* by Bob Dylan (Minnesotan here, had to pick a local) 

""So long honey babe. Where I'm bound, I can't tell. Goodbye's too good a word, babe. So I'll just say, Fare thee well. I ain't a-saying you treated me unkind. You could've done better, but I don't mind. You just kinda wasted my, precious time. But don't think twice, it's all right.""

I've always liked the smooth sarcasm in this part of the song. Like nah, booze hunny, don't you worry. You just had me convinced for years you were helping my life circumstances, not harming them. It's got this slight arrogance, not overly so, just a healthy dose of superiority that I think is fitting and acceptable in sobriety.

Here's the thing. Wishing and regretting and obsessing about all the times 'ol booze hunny babe stole the goodness out of a moment won't take them away. I don't have a DeLorean time machine to go back and change my choices. Spending my time and energy with shame, guilt, and regret is only hurting me. In fact, it's allowing booze hunny babe to steal more goodness, from today, the present. And she just don't deserve anymore!

Our time is incredibly precious. The longer I stay sober the more I realize how true that is. I'm gonna stick my snobby nose in the air and say fare thee well, to the booze and to the regret. I'm choosing to let this roll off my shoulders, to free me from the ongoing waste of my time. If I don't mind, that means booze hunny babe, that bully, is not in control. And if booze hunny babe isn't in control, that means I AM.

Since I don't have a DeLorean I also can't see where I'm going. But I can tell you that at least for today, I will not be drinking with you sober friends. 

PS-It is inspiring, empowering, and honoring to host this DCI. If you've got at least 30 days under your belt, I encourage you to consider it.

Morning friends! 

Well, that's it for me! My time as host is up. Thanks for being here with me this week!

I said it yesterday and I’ll say it again: This week of hosting the DCI has been amazing. You are truly some of the kindest and most supportive people I’ve ever met. Your kindness with each other is so inspiring and you all make the world a better place. If you have 30 days of sobriety or more and would like to host the DCI, let u/SaintHomer know. He can provide you with the details you need to get started. 

What does your Saturday look like? I love Saturdays. I love waking up without an alarm and drinking coffee leisurely while doing the crossword or scrolling through here. I write the grocery list and do some tidying up. I might do a deep clean, or I might go shopping, or I might read a book or flake out in front of the TV. In the summer, I almost always take my coffee cup and do a tour of my garden to see what’s blooming, and then sit down to listen to the birds and watch the squirrels. I’ll take my dog out for a long romp and take in the sun and the warm and the urban wildlife.

Those are the things I usually choose to do. I’ve had enough excitement in my life, if I’m honest. I spent 20+ years doing exciting things like clubbing and partying all night and my days recovering from all the exciting.

While my life is a lot quieter than it was then, it also holds more opportunity and freedom. I get to choose how I spend my time now, and that is a hell of a thing. I’m not bound to the chains of drinking and recovering from drinking anymore, at least as long as I choose not to drink , that is. I’m up for anything, and I have the energy for it too. There is no more “one day” or “tomorrow.” There is now, there is choice, there is freedom, and I’m so grateful to be here for it.

Have a great day, friends, and again, thank you for being here.

4133,2023-05-10 11:18:15-05:00,1683735495.0,trees,t5_2r9vp,"Hi guys!

I’m a male, 24 and started regularly using cannabis around last May, occasionally in the week but mainly weekends. 

Before I used cannabis I used to drink heavily, not regularly but every week at least once I’d drink probably 20 units, often closer and exceeding 30. I got myself into right messes, drunk texting, arguing with strangers about the most irrelevant things, getting upset easily, awful anxiety the next day etc. 

Ever since covid lockdowns I found my relationship with alcohol has stunk, but cannabis has opened my mind.

I quit drinking for good on Easter, and plan to still smoke. I’ve personally found cannabis to be so much kinder on my brain, it makes me feel good and I don’t get horrible anxiety the next day and can be productive. And most importantly, it’s the reason I think I’ve been able to quit the drink. I’ve seen it for what it is, and I don’t like it. 

I was wondering if there’s anyone in a similar situation to me? Used to be a big party person and is now happy with a smoke and chilling out playing some video games, listening to music or just talking with friends. I feel like I’m too young to be giving up that party life but maybe that’s just the social pressure I’m feeling from the stereotypes of being young.

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hello everyone, I'm very excited to host the DCI thread this week! I want to thank /u/DesiringSobriety for doing such an amazing job hosting last week, and all of the incredible mods of this beautiful corner of the internet that do so much to help us all.  

As I come up on 100 days, I've been reflecting on a lot of the lessons I've learned so far in this early stage of sobriety. Each day I'll share one of them in hope that they can help drive discussion, sharing and insight from this beautiful community. I'm far from being an expert on sobriety, but my hope is that these little write ups will help encourage the newcomers and will invite some folks with a lot of time to share what they've learned with all of us. Thank you so much for allowing me to participate and be of help in my favorite place on the internet.  

So let's start with my favorite, and one that I have struggled with immensely: **PATIENCE.**  

My first post here came only a few days in to my latest attempt at sobriety. I couldn't sleep, I was anxious, and unbelievably sad. It was like everything that used to be in color was now in black and white. It really scared me, too, because when I'd been able to string together a few days in the past I always jumped on to that pink cloud immediately. This time, it was like everything was wrong, broken, and could never be fixed.   

I was desperate and begging for help, and someone told me that it took them around 60 days to really feel like they balanced out. I was staring at my single digit counter wondering how in the world I was going to be able to suffer like this for 60 days. My drinking brain, like a panicked little rat in a cage, was darting around looking for another solution that would help me stop feeling so absolutely miserable.  

And there just wasn't one. The only thing it could think of was to drink, and I knew where that would lead.  

I remember sitting on my couch, staring at the Christmas tree, on the verge of tears and a thought came in to my mind.  

*You don't have to do anything else right now. There is no other solution. You just have to be here, in this moment, not drinking.* ***That's it***.    

It was like a weight, however small, was lifted from my shoulders.   

A lot of us that abuse alcohol are always trying to control, always trying to figure out the solution, always trying to make sense of everything, so that we can have what we want **right now**.  

The thing is, with sobriety we can't have that healthy, happy, ideal life that we know sits off in the distance without earning it. With drinking we could have that ""good feeling"" right away. That works great for those of us that need our results without any work.  

But sobriety requires work. And it requires **patience**.   

There is no rushing this. We have to be patient and allow ourselves to heal. We have to allow ourselves to be humbled. We have to allow ourselves to learn. And we have to allow ourselves to be in pain. We also have to allow ourselves to be happy when it comes, and allow it to pass when it passes.   

For me, patience is a lesson hard learned. Every time I think I have sobriety figured out, and I start trying to rush things or do too much, I start to feel squirrely and thoughts of drinking pop into my mind. I drank a shocking amount of high proof liquor for a long time. It's going to take a serious amount of time for me to really truly heal, not only physically, but more importantly emotionally and mentally. 

So I'll leave you with one of my favorite sayings you'll hear in sober circles and programs: **Easy does it.**  

Be patient with yourselves. Be patient with your sobriety. Be patient with the people in your life. There is no rush, and there is no rushing this. Yesterday is gone, tomorrow isn't here yet, all we have is right now.   

So my question to all of you is: How has patience played a part in your sobriety so far, or how can you learn to be more patient as you continue down this path we're all on?",t2_sn2zt6ss,"The Daily Check-In for Sunday, April 9th: Just for today, I am NOT drinking!",t3_12g85xw,12g85xw,leftpointsonly,700,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/12g85xw/the_daily_checkin_for_sunday_april_9th_just_for/,0.99,269,drinking,0.1020853370428085,0.0130985835567116,0.0699200555682182,0.047309573739767,0.0721451118588447,0.3976123034954071,0.0217814911156892,0.130496934056282,0.1027547046542167,0.042795930057764,0.3401971459388733,0.6598028540611267

“I can quit drinking no problem. I’ve done it hundreds of times.”

There was a period of time when I quit drinking every morning, only to start again later that evening.

I thought living without alcohol would be easy for me. I set my mind to it and it’s done, no problem. Despite all the people who told me it was hard, I thought my story would be different. 

Oh, how wrong I was. It took a lot of learning to get sobriety to stick for me. But as they say, “Fall down 7 times, stand up 8.”

Never quit quitting. It’s hard, but it’s doable, and we’re all here to help.

These are not my friends, they're my relatives. No I'm not giving into ""peer pressure"" by partaking once to show them that I'm not an asshole when I'm drunk. Business associates often get drunk together when they first meet for the exact same reason. There's no hiding your true nature when you're totally wasted. After my in-laws have all had the opportunity to see me pound back 12 beers and still be kind and thoughtful ntowards my wife, I feel perfectly fine saying no. But honestly, drinking is part of human culture. It's basic social etiquette to show that you are willing to partake in other people's culture at least once. My in-laws happen to be toothless countryside folk, most of whom never even graduated third grade. They respect me for not drinking with them anymore. But I know they respect that I did it the one time and still acted like a good respectable human. Them getting me to say bad things in vietnamese was just a joke. Everyone laughed when I repeated the vulgar expressions, and my wife told me what it was that I said. Sometimes they told me to say certain things to my wife and the same guys who told me to say vulgarities quickly grabbed my shoulder and said shook their hand no no no. Then I shake my hand to say no and make a motion that my wife will cut my throat if I said it. They all laughed. It was simply a bonding experience and they were all welcoming and supportive. After the twelfth beer I started sipping because my stomach was full. There was no more attempt made to make me drink more because I'd already bypassed their little countryside test. I don't believe it had anything to do with proving my manhood to these family members. It was simply a way for me to show them that I will always respect and love my wife, and that I'm a good person even while wasted. It's the same thing as how they always give me the roosters balls to eat out of the chicken pot because it shows that I'm willing to partake in their culture, and again that I can support my wife in a multicultural relationship. Roosters balls are a delicacy here. They find it hilarious when they put them in my bowl and I grab my balls and smirk at them. Same thing with chickens hearts, and all the other organs that westerners would usually be disgusted by. It's all about assimilating with my uneducated in-laws. They want to test my character, and I respect that just like I do with new business associates.

When it comes to friends, of course I don't give in to ""peer pressure"". I don't have any friends who drink like that. 

This experience for me is entirely to do with my in-laws who I will be associating with for the rest of my life. They have some weird tests, but it's not like a peer pressure situation. It's a courtesy thing where they just want to let me know that I'm welcome to join their family traditions. 

Like I said in my comments below, I now eat and sit with the sober circle and feel no pressure to join them. I know my wife's parents and grandparents (her grandparents mean more to me since they actually raised my wife) respect me for not drinking and not smoking. 

As for the others? They are all happy to see me, they all share a little bond with me after our one drunken riverboat cruise. They invite me to drink, but I just say no and sit with my wife and her grandparents and the few other men and women who don't drink. Simple as that. 

From the west we obviously have a reputation for drinking too much hard liquor and far too frequently. 

But I enjoy a beer about as often as Vietnamese do. 

That is, on special occasions or social gatherings. 

My problem is how much beer. I like 1-2 decent quality beers and some good relaxed conversation.

But I find over here my cup just keeps getting refilled. 4,5,6,7 beers later and the case is empty. It's just too much for my stomach or bladder to handle to be honest. I didn't even drink like that when I was a delinquent teenager. 

People start getting obnoxious and getting me to say rude and inappropriate things in Vietnamese (which I don't speak very well). And they try to make me say it over and over and over again because they're totally wasted. 

I miss that culture of the west where you can take part in the drinking circle and everyone just drinks as much as they feel like. No pressure to gulp down 5L each. 

I honestly like the taste of Tiger. It's a pretty good beer for a mass-produced brew. 

But I've had to completely give up social drinking while I'm here. My body just can't handle that much anymore. I'm only 27 but I take antidepressants. 

I don't like to drink alone and my wife doesn't like beer. 

So that's my story. This Canadian is done drinking beer. I like the taste, hate the drunk. 

Not meant to be derogatory at all. This is just me expressing myself. I understand every culture is different and I've taken part in the drinking circle once with every new group I meet just to build that trust with them. But from then on I just refuse. It never just stops at 1-2 beers. 

Also, ice in warm beer? Cold out of the fridge man. Cold out of the fridge.

Happy Friday, friends!

When I was a drinker, Fridays were for blowing off steam. At my most controlled drinking, I didn’t drink through the week and I was pretty proud of that. I had no problem telling people. “Oh, I don’t drink through the week. I only drink on weekends.” FFS. 

I left out the part where I drank so much on the weekends (often starting on Thursdays with “Friday Eve” and right through to Sunday) that on Mondays I was usually terribly hungover and counting down the hours until I could get to bed. I knew that calling in sick because of a hangover was a sign of a drinking problem and I didn’t have one of those so I never called in sick. I’d ride it out, I’d puke in the bathroom at work, I’d nap in my car, but I didn’t have a drinking problem because I was at work. Tuesdays I might feel a bit better, but the exhaustion was still overwhelming and I might still be feeling the headache and nausea. By Wednesday, my will to live was returning and with it, my urge to drink. I would start counting down to Friday. On Thursday, I’d feel back to normal and itchy and anxious to start drinking. If I was good and hadn’t come up with an excuse to drink (good day, bad day, manager annoyed me, coworker annoyed me, whatever), then by Friday I had steam to blow off and it was ON. I would crack a beer as I walked through the door and drink myself good and drunk until I passed out. In between there I might pick a fight with my fiancé, ignore my kids, cry on my neighbour, dance in the kitchen, who knows. It was a crap shoot. But I had steam to blow off.

Now that I’m sober, I don’t have steam to blow off anymore. My anxiety is down and I have been learning healthy ways of dealing with my emotions and the hard things in life so that they don’t build up. Now my Fridays don’t need to be about getting wasted to “celebrate.” Not waking up to an alarm is celebration enough. Going to bed with my make up washed off and my pyjamas on in clean bedding is celebration enough. Hitting the grocery store to pick out my treats for the night and melting my brain in front of a show or a movie while eating as much chocolate and cookies as I can fit in my face is celebration enough. Playing a game with one of my kids is celebration enough. Waking on Saturday with no alarm and no headache or anxiety or panic or vomiting is celebration enough. 

What do you have planned for your Friday? Mine involves junk food and lots of it, cold Coke Zero, and melting my brain in front of the TV, and I’m all in for it too.

Also - if you have 30 days of sobriety or more and want to take a turn hosting the DCI, please reach out to u/SaintHomer.

Living sober in a booze-obsessed culture can suck ass at times. It can be hard. But it is doable.

This time last year I went to my first in-person event since COVID, a gala event for work. I was anxious because COVID, I was anxious because work, I was anxious because sober. I had only been sober for a couple of months and I had no idea how the hell I was going to get through it without drinking. 

But I did it. I drank tonic and lime and cranberry and soda with lime and smiled through the frustrating questions of “What are you drinking?” and inevitable subsequent conversation about everyone’s favourite poison, but also watched with great interest how the alcohol changed people’s behaviour and demeanor. You seriously can see and feel a mood change with alcohol, and it doesn’t take much. People are also not nearly as entertaining or funny as they think they are when they’re drinking. I also escaped to the bathroom a lot, and checked in here and with sober friends I had on standby to help keep me grounded, and reminded myself that it’s only a few hours and I could get through a few hours sober before going home to the comfort of my family and my bed with a clear head and conscience. And again, I did it. And again, the sober gifts presented themselves: I was sober when I bumped into a dear former colleague I hadn’t seen in years. We hugged from the heart and had a few moments to catch up before both of our rides showed up. I left the exchange feeling delight instead of shame.

We went on vacation with friends who drink. We always drank heavily together, and this was a family vacation with our kids and yet it was all built around when the adults could drink, which sucked, quite frankly. We cut the fun rides short so we could go to lunch so the adults could drink. I was the only one who played with the kids in the pool because the adults wanted to sit and drink. At night, there was tonnes of entertainment throughout the resort but there were also really drunk adults wandering around so it wasn’t great for the kids to be exposed to it, and the adults were starting to get tired because they were sobering up so they all wanted to go to bed – except me. I was still good to go. That sucked. BUT bonus – coffee line ups are shorter early in the morning, and sunrises are beautiful, and kids are always game to explore their surroundings in the morning and there are fewer people to deal with.

Also – if you think you’re the only one not drinking, you’re probably not. The sober people just aren’t as loud. 😊

Drinking isn’t the great fix all that Big Alcohol would have you believe, trust me.

Morning friends! Happy Monday!

When I started looking to get my drinking under control I was really looking for a set of instructions. I was prepared for a little bit of work, but I wanted instructions that would be easy to follow.

I never found them. 

Instead I found people who were willing to show me the tools that work for them. 

I found this sub, and as my frustrated, sad, desperate hungover self scrolled post after post, my soul shouted “ME TOO!” 

I found Annie Grace and her This Naked Mind podcast, and the shouts of “ME TOO!” got louder. 

I found Laura McKowen’s book “We Are the Luckiest” and my soul shouted again “ME TOO!”

I found podcasts and journaling. I found urge surfing and playing the tape forward. But most importantly, in addition to tools, I found my people. 

The people who understand drinking and all the things it gives and then takes away. 

The people who understand that we don’t need to hear what pieces of shit we are because we already know that. We tell ourselves that every damn day.

We need the people who say “ME TOO!” and then show us that different and better is possible. That imperfect is the human condition, and human is who we are, but we are worthy of love and we can live beautiful lives without losing ourselves to booze. 

We’re flawed, but we’re fighting for better, and I’m so proud of you and to be fighting along side you. We’re worth it.

She's never even tried to go a day without alcohol despite my trying to set boundaries, and when she starts drinking she just keeps going and doesn't stop.

Not only that, but she gets all stupid and starts slurring her words and generally loses about 30 IQ points whenever she drinks and at 33 years old I'm just over it.

I'm tired.

How I do set boundaries and say what I want to say without coming across as rude?

First off, thank you for the out pouring of support from the r/Construction community! I really didn't expect that and I'm glad y'll appreciated the sentiment. The crew seemed to as well. I hope everyone lets you use their bathroom and offers you food and snacks! I tried to get to many of you, but my ability to keep up trailed off after about mid-day today so my apologies to whomever I wasn't able to get too!

Second, it was a total hit! I ended up running to the store as soon as their opened this morning to pick up more stuff based on the comments last night. The final spread was an extra large case of waters, a case of Gatorade, a case of Minute Maid 0 Sugar Lemonade, two 20lbs bags of ice, 40 sandwiches (19 cubanitos, 20 without pickles or mayo per request of the comments haha), 16 cookies, and 2 bags of lays baked chips. I also set out plates, paper towels, and hand sanitizer. As you can see in the after photo, I'm left with 8 sandwiches, 7 waters, 3 cookies, and the lays chip bag with 3 chips haha. I'll call that a success!

They were super thankful for it and had the apprentice stand at attention and salute me every time I came to top off the ice and put more drinks in the cooler 😂 (which I did between meetings today). The yard looks great too and looking forward to when it finally sets in!

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

\---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**  A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Morning friends, happy Wednesday!

Sobriety has given me a whole lot of gifts in life I didn’t know I wanted or needed.

I have white knuckled through some really tough moments sober. On the surface, they looked like they were impossible to get through but I rode them out and found on the other side that it was so worth it. There were some incredibly beautiful moments with my family or friends, or even myself, that sober me was present for after riding a really tough craving.

Sobriety has let me start building the life of my dreams, moment by moment, by making the next right choice. Sometimes the next right choice is going to bed. Sometimes it’s a long walk. Once it was finally rolling the coins in my overflowing piggy bank so that I could dust my dresser and the mess was really pissing me off, and I came out like $500 up because I had also stuffed bills in there at some point. Once it was a government-issued cheque buried in a pile of papers and mail I had been putting off dealing with when I was drinking. Procrastination was something I was really good at as a drinker. I was always going to deal with everything “tomorrow.” Sober, I was learning to deal with things in the moment and on this day I decided to finally deal with the pile of papers that had been there for years because again the mess was pissing me off, and boom – I found $250 in an old government-issued cheque!

I have new friends I can be vulnerable and honest with in ways I never could be with family members or life-long friends. I can say things to them (you!) without fear of judgement or starting a fight. People on this journey just get it. Shame dies in the light.

But the biggest gifts sobriety has given me are trust in myself again, and far fewer regrets. I can look at myself in the mirror and feel pride. I can trust that while I’m going to make mistakes and sometimes I’m going to mess up, it’s not going to be because I drank.

And genuine joy that bubbles up and deep belly laughs that bring tears to my eyes because they’re so real.

Seriously – if you’re struggling through a craving, stay strong, stay sober, and look for the gifts – they’re there. You can do this, friends.
