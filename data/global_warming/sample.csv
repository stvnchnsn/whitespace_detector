13,2023-05-20 04:10:17-05:00,conspiracy,USA ranks 62nd globally by average life expectancy despite the fact that the USA ranks first by average health spending. Americans are being scammed by their own healthcare industry.,"Please share your experiences of outrageous medical bills, medical debt, and or medical bankruptcy. 

It is truly embarrassing that the most expensive healthcare program on Earth found in the USA results in a 62nd ranking in average life expectancy statistic for American Citizens. American citizens are getting scammed by the medical industry.

AMA about childhood trauma and the effect it can have on our mental health!","Over the past twenty years, I have conducted research on trauma globally. My work has focused on the following questions:

1. Why, when people experience similar traumatic events do some struggle while others appear resilient?
2. How do traumatic events get under the skin and cause physical and mental health problems?
3. What can science tell us about how to help people recover from traumatic events and thrive?

Today, I have partnered with Number Story to raise awareness around the role of childhood trauma and Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and their long-term effects on mental and physical health.

Excited to answer any questions you may have. My goal is for you to leave filled with hope and equipped with healing strategies for yourself and loved ones. **I will be starting at 1pm ET (17 UT), AMA!**

142,2023-05-02 11:24:18-05:00,atheism,"URGENT: The EARN IT Act, backed by the anti-LGBT hate group NCOSE, will destroy online privacy and remove LGBT media, abortion resources, domestic abuse resources, and so much more. Despite being a US bill, the impact will be felt GLOBALLY. We need your help.","S. 1207, known as the EARN IT Act of 2023, claims to be focused on child safety on the Internet and the removal of child pornography and sexually exploitative material targeted at children. In reality, it is an effort by the National Center on Sexual Exploitation (NCOSE), an anti-pornography group founded primarily by Catholics, to purge the Internet of all sexual material - anything they *consider* sexual. This includes sexual health information, abortion resources, pornography of course, and yes, every scrap of pro-LGBTQ+ media out there.

Specifically, the act will allow the US government to establish a commission dedicated to scrubbing ""sexually exploitative materal"" from the Internet. If a site is found to not be proactively monitoring for and deleting anything the commission considers exploitative, that site can lose their liability protections under Section 230 of the Communications Act, which keep websites from being liable for the content their users post. Ultimately, if a site does not comply to their satisfaction and loses its protections, it can be sued into shutting down.

Let me rephrase.

Under S. 1207, if ANY website does not comply to the standards outlined by a CHRISTIAN COMMITTEE, it can be PERMANENTLY SHUT DOWN.

To make matters worse, sites will be required to allow the government to bypass their encryption methods, granting access to user data like location and IP addresses. They must either create dedicated backdoors for government accounts (which can be hacked), access content before and after encryption processes (allowing skilled users to access the info themselves), or simply not encrypt their content at all (letting AVERAGE users access the info). This will COMPLETELY destroy privacy. Exposed user info lets predators determine your exact location, find your financial information, discover your name and face, the list goes on. In essence, this bill does exactly the opposite of what it says it will do and makes the Internet EXTREMELY unsafe.

The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee approved this bill unanimously and it is being pushed for markup for THIS WEEK. (For future readers, that's the first week of May 2023.) This will allow it to be voted on by the Senate and House of Representatives within the month, and it can go into effect by JUNE. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who originally pushed for this bill back in 2020, is hoping to fast-track the bill and get it approved before it's possible to do anything about it. 

But don't lose hope. This bill has been introduced twice before, and both times, thanks to the efforts of activists worldwide, it failed before it ever reached the President. It has never been pushed this quickly before, however, and we all need to pitch in to stop it.

Here's how you can help:

If you live in the US and want to fight this bill directly, contact the House of Representatives and the Senate directly! Here are a couple of links to find contact info for your senators and representatives and a guide on how to effectively communicate with them.

When we started dating, my bf said he liked my look, even though he himself dresses very basically. He even hyped me up when I showed him new makeup looks or outfits. However a few days ago as I was getting ready for work, he kept making weird faces at me. I asked him what was up and he said nothing but kept shaking his head. This really irritated me because he was obviously bothered but I wasn‚Äôt going to entertain his huffy behavior. I finished getting ready and tried to kiss him goodbye like I always do but he just turned away from me. This really hurt my feelings and I can‚Äôt even lie, I did cry a little bit on the way to work. I tried to text him during my breaks but he didn‚Äôt respond at all.

When I finally got home and he still wouldn‚Äôt say anything to me, I lost it. I asked him what his problem was and why he‚Äôs treating me this way. He motioned to my clothes and simply said ‚Äúthat‚Äù. I obviously didn‚Äôt know what he meant so I asked what about it and he said something like ‚ÄúI just can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôd wear that to work‚Äù I was confused because this is what I always wear. I told him that and he was like ‚Äúyeah I know, it‚Äôs so unprofessional, you‚Äôll never accomplish anything looking like that‚Äù I couldnt believe he said that to me. I was fighting back tears at this point, trying to tell him that my job allows it and that I‚Äôm not the only one at work that dresses like this. He just kept repeating himself and said that clearly it‚Äôs not that good of a job if they allow me to look like that.

I couldnt take it anymore and left to go to my sisters house. He called me and I told him to fuck off, that I wasn‚Äôt gonna change my look because he didn‚Äôt like it. He called me selfish, saying that I‚Äôm ruining our future together because I can‚Äôt sacrifice one thing so we could have a good life together. Even though my job allows it AND it‚Äôs a good paying office job. There was no reason for me to sacrifice anything. After that, I hung up on him and ignored him the rest of the night. I explained everything to my sister and she does agree my look is unprofessional, but if it doesn‚Äôt cause issues at work then it shouldn‚Äôt matter.

The next day, I had about a million messages from him saying how selfish I‚Äôm being and ruining our futures. I started feeling really guilty for leaving. I feel like I‚Äôm not wrong here but even my sister kind of agreed with him so I don‚Äôt know.

TLDR; My boyfriend got upset that I wore my usual alternative style to work saying it‚Äôs unprofessional. We started arguing and I left. I told him I wouldn‚Äôt change, he says I‚Äôm being selfish. Am I the asshole here?

""Reading through the comments and I noticed a few reoccurring questions so I‚Äôll answer best as I can. As for my job, I work in insurance. I don‚Äôt want to give too much information more than that for privacy but this is a well paying job. I‚Äôve gotten promoted twice in the two and a half years Ive been here and my direct manager is covered in tattoos. I also don‚Äôt wear anything inappropriate, I‚Äôm always fully covered so my appearance genuinely is not an issue.

As for his sudden change‚Ä¶ I really don‚Äôt understand it either. I guess it is possible someone said something to him but he didn‚Äôt mentioned that. We haven‚Äôt talked since I came back either because he‚Äôs ignoring me now. We don‚Äôt technically live together, he just stays over at my place most of the time so I‚Äôm assuming he went back to his moms. I do plan on having a serious discussion with him about what happened and our relationship.""

*Girl, why did you have to leave YOUR place?*

""I left because I was very emotional and didn‚Äôt want to make things worse. We don‚Äôt live together but he does stay with me most days. Things have been so good the entire relationship so I was completely caught off guard by this. I feel guilty because he does seem concerned for me but he also isn‚Äôt listening which is upsetting.""

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/user/Responsible_Log5346/comments/130brx1/update_aita_for_refusing_to_change_my_style_at/)**: April 27, 2023 (5 days later)**

I was not allowed to post an update on the AITA sub so I decided to post it here for anyone who wanted to know what ended up happening.

So you guys were right. My bf finally came back to my apartment Sunday, no message or call, just walked in like nothing happened. I immediately started questioning him, asking where the hell he‚Äôs been and why hasn‚Äôt he been answering me. He gives me a half assed response saying his mom needed help with something and he ‚Äúforgot‚Äù to tell me. I told him he can‚Äôt just ignore me for three days and he said he wasn‚Äôt, even though he CLEARLY was.

I was already getting upset so I told him that even if he wasn‚Äôt ignoring me, the way he treated me before he left was messed up. Of course he just starts saying he didn‚Äôt do anything wrong and that he was just trying to help me see how I‚Äôm hurting us both by dressing the way I do. I tell him for like the 500th time that my job does not care what I wear and it‚Äôs not his concern. He said even if my work was okay with it, other people do and he shouldn‚Äôt have to suffer because of it.

This is where shit went south. I started yelling who is saying that and why does it even matter. He says no one but he ‚Äúsees the way people stare‚Äù and it ‚Äúembarrasses him‚Äù. I cried because I was so hurt. He told me to stop being dramatic and that it isn‚Äôt a big deal, but at this point I‚Äôm beyond pissed. I said if he‚Äôs so embarrassed of how I dress, he can date someone else. He starts to freak out saying that‚Äôs not what he meant and he‚Äôs just worried what people think. I keep asking what people, because clearly their opinion is more important than how I feel.

He just kept looking around and trying to change the subject, saying shit like ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no one specific but‚Äù. I told him I didn‚Äôt want to hear it and to leave right now. He was saying things like ‚Äúare you serious‚Äù and ‚Äúyou‚Äôre really gonna act this way over clothes‚Äù. I just told him to get out over and over and eventually he left, making a big deal of stomping out and slamming the door.

Monday I put all his shit in a box and left it outside and texted him he can come pick it up when he brings me back my key. I told him we are done because I won‚Äôt be with someone who treats me like this. He kept messaging me but I just ignored all of it. He came by at some point and picked up his stuff but didn‚Äôt leave the key. I was extremely worried that he would try to come in my apartment while I was asleep or away so I called my dad and he changed my locks for me.

Overall I‚Äôm just extremely emotionally exhausted and heartbroken. I knew his behavior towards me was shitty but I was truly hoping it was him being bad at communicating. I was way too hung up on it being about my style and not him being manipulative like you guys were saying. I do think maybe someone specific got into his head but he wouldn‚Äôt say who. Either way it doesn‚Äôt really matter because it‚Äôs over. I appreciate all the kind comments and messages from the last post. He is toxic and I‚Äôm annoyed and embarrassed I didn‚Äôt want to see it.",LucyAriaRose,1252,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/137c6qx/aita_for_refusing_to_change_my_style_at_work_even/,change,0.4423881471157074

I opened up the changing table and it was genuinely disgusting. I‚Äôm pretty sure there was baby poop on it!! I couldn‚Äôt even tell what else was on it. 

I have a diaper bag that turns into a portable changing table in the back section and it‚Äôs pretty easy and quick to set up, so I went into the accessible stall and changed him as quickly as I could. 

As we were leaving the restroom, an older woman approaches us and very rudely tells me not to use the accessible restroom to change a baby ever, and that because I used it she had to use a regular stall and those make her legs hurt. I said I was sorry and she called me an a-hole and told me I needed to learn common sense. 

My husband agrees with me, but I told a friend about this and she told me I was a jerk. I just don‚Äôt know.

---

G'day, Chris Proctor, senior design lead, here with another weapons balance blog! 



We shipped the [7.0.5 mid-Season balance update](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/destiny-2-twab-3-30-23) a few weeks back. That update was largely PvP-focused and was mainly made up of changes we'd been testing in Season 21 and pulled forward. As a result, this set of changes is focused on systemic changes in PvE.



For Season 21, we've got a substantial number of changes to hip-fire reticles, various changes to a bunch of Exotic weapons and a few other bits and pieces, let's get into it.


##Weapon Reticles
[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/embed/4TkhufSNgi8)

We've looked at player feedback around how reticles convey less information at high field-of-view (FOV) settings, information that isn't obvious mid-combat, and Exotic weapons whose perk state can be hard to track and have rebuilt several weapon reticles to address these.


##Hip-Fire Reticles and FOV


The two reticle elements on most weapons illustrate the current cones for autoaim (a.k.a. bullet bending) and accuracy (a.k.a. error angle), using moving circles and crosshairs.



These are clamped in size on screen to avoid growing too large or too small and hence blocking the very center of the screen, or overlapping too much of your weapon and the action in front of you‚Äîat default FOV these elements move as your autoaim and accuracy change, but at high FOV they typically can't shrink enough to show the current angles, resulting in them being fairly static.



We've rebuilt the reticles for the following weapon types so that they move more visibly at high FOV, while still conveying the current state of the weapon accurately.



* Fusion Rifle
* Hand Cannon
* Sidearm
* Trace Rifle

We plan to update other weapon reticles in a similar way in a future release.



Shotgun reticles also now scale with FOV, such that the reticle will closely match the pellet spread regardless of your selected FOV (and note that as of Lightfall they dynamically scale with Shotgun pellet spread angle changes).


##Charge Meters


Fusion Rifle charge and Sword guard energy are critical aspects of these weapons, which until now required relying on cues built into the weapon's visuals or audio‚Äîwe've updated their hip-fire reticles to include this information as well.



* Fusion Rifles now have a charge meter under the reticle.
* Sword reticles now show the current Sword guard energy.

##Experimental Aim Down Sights Reticle


Our hip-fire reticles are built with technology that lets them scale with weapon autoaim and accuracy, but our aim down sights reticles are typically hand built for each specific weapon and don't necessarily show this information.



We've been experimenting with an approach that keeps the hand-built aesthetics of a weapon's sights or scope, but replaces the center crosshair or red dot with a variant of the hip-fire reticle. We decided we'd get this into your hands and see how it feels in the live game before looking into this type of reticle further.



* Shayura's Wrath

   * Now has an aim-down-sights reticle that reacts to the weapon's accuracy and autoaim state, and ties into ""red reticle,"" meaning this will change color when an enemy that's within this weapon's engagement range is under the reticle.

##Custom Exotic Weapon Reticles


Plenty of Exotic weapons have perks with states or counts that are important information for players - we've added reticle elements to show these to several Exotic weapons (note that Exotic Swords and Fusion Rifles also benefit from the above charge meter and Sword meter elements).



Note that some Exotic weapons already convey their state very clearly and weren't included in this pass.



The specific additions to Exotic weapons are:



* Charge meter added to Exotic weapons whose base weapon type doesn't typically have a charge meter.

   * Devil's Ruin
   * Salvation's Grip


   * Grand Overture
* Perk counter shows pips for perked shots.

   * Quicksilver Storm grenade count.
   * Ace of Spades Memento Mori shot count.
   * Lumina Noble Rounds shot count.
   * Traveler's Chosen Gathering Light stacks.
* Perk progress meter shows perk buildup.

   * The Manticore
* Perk active shows when the Exotic perk is active.

   * Hawkmoon
   * Ager's Scepter
   * Tarrabah
   * Touch of Malice
   * Cryosthesia 77k
   * Trinity Ghoul
* Charge meter and perk counter.

   * Vex Mythoclast

We'll keep an eye out for opportunities for custom reticle work for other Exotic weapons.


##General

####Inspection Screen Improvements
[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/embed/kWUViHovz1E)

With the release of Season of the Deep, we are also doing an overhaul to the way we showcase weapons and other items in the Inspection Screen with some highly requested improvements. You'll now be able to do the following when previewing weapons:



* Rotate them around the same way you would a Sparrow or piece of armor.
* Added support for ambient VFX to play for weapons that have them.

This applies to your inventory, and also when inspecting ornaments in the Eververse store. These tech improvements have had compounding benefits, enabling us to also allow you to rotate ships and preview their contrails. We‚Äôve also removed the depth-of-field blur from our weapon, ship, and armor preview screens to allow you to see all the angles of your gear better!


##Full Auto Melee


Knowing how popular the full auto (now called ""full auto firing"") setting was, we've implemented a matching ""full auto melee"" setting that lets you continue melee attacking with your fist, charged melee, Sword, Glaive, or roaming Super melee by holding down the appropriate input.



This is explained in more detail [here](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/destiny-2-accessibility-set).


####Weapon Archetypes


* Bows

   * Tyranny of Heaven's stats were always weirdly low, and we were touching these weapons anyway so opted to update its stats while we were in there.
* Submachine Guns

   * Aggressive Submachine Guns have surged in PvP, they need to be brought back into band‚Äîwe're doing that in a way that keeps them viable by reducing both base and crit damage a little, requiring higher precision to reach their optimal time to kill (TTK).
   * Reduced base damage from 15 to 14.

      * Increased precision hit multiplier from 1.45 to 1.5 (crit damage goes from 21.8 to 21).
   * The Immortal is such a stat monster that no other Aggressive SMG can compete, we've brought its range in while allowing it to continue to excel in other areas.

      * Reduced base range value by 10.
* Sniper Rifles

   * Sniper Rifles are a very safe option, and we don't want to also make them dominant, but there's some room to bring their damage up to improve their feel in PvE. Note that rapid-fire Sniper Rifles also got a large reserves bump and reduced recoil in the Season 20 mid-Season balance update. We'll keep an eye on this and may bring them up a little more in future if this doesn't move the needle.
   * Increased PvE damage by 10%.
   * Note: Izanagi's Burden's Honed Edge perk shots don't receive this buff, all other Exotic Sniper Rifles receive the buff as written.
* Scout Rifles

   * Long Arm was inadvertently receiving the damage bonus vs minors for Exotics, so we've addressed that (it still receives the Scout Rifle PvE damage buff from the Season 20 mid-Season balance update).

##Exotic Weapons


[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/blt149447af29c6b588/6463a4851514068020f30a29/TP_2023_TWAB_Graviton_Lance_01.jpg)

* Eyes of Tomorrow's multi-targeted missile volley and ""Adaptive Ordnance"" Exotic trait suggest it should be used to kill groups of enemies, but the Rocket Launcher ammo economy doesn't really allow for that. But what if smart use of the weapon against groups refunded ammo?

   * Killing 4 targets with a missile volley will refund one ammo.
* Graviton Lance's performance feels Exotic, but it was easy to miss out on the full damage of a burst because so much of it was back-loaded, and we felt the tuning of Revision Zero's Heavy Rounds 2-burst would be a good fit.

   * Increased RPM from 257 to 300 (reduced burst delay by 20%, now matches Revision Zero's Hakke Heavy Rounds rate of fire).
   * Rebalanced damage per shot.

      * Increased first shot damage from:

         * Body: 9.5 to 19.
         * Crit: 15.7 to 31.4.
      * Decreased second shot damage from:

         * Body: 35.6 to 25.6.
         * Crit: 58.7 to 42.3.

* Jade Rabbit is a strong PvP Scout Rifle, but it was difficult to keep track of the state of the Exotic perk, and refunding a single ammo just wasn't impressive enough for an Exotic‚Äîthese changes make the state clearer and provide more reward for precision.

   * Added buff text to show when Fate of All Fools increased body shot damage is active.
   * Quickly hitting 3 critical hits now refunds 3 shots instead of 1.
* Flying around with The Manticore is some silly fun, but we wanted it to be more rewarding, mobile, and sustainable. With this change you should be able to remain airborne for longer and be safer while doing so.

   * Increased the catalyst's damage resistance from tier 3 to tier 4.
   * Increased movement speed during hang time.
   * Activating the catalyst perk (through an airborne kill or sustained damage following an airborne kill) now partially refills the magazine.
* Lumina's cap on Noble Rounds was 5, while working on Exotic weapon reticles we opted to match Ace of Spades' Memento Mori shot count to improve consistency between the two and give Lumina a little buff at the same time.

   * Increased Noble Rounds cap from 5 to 6.

* Heartshadow wasn't quite hitting the fantasy we wanted it to, so we've made it easier to exploit the Exotic perks.

   * Damage increase now activates quicker while invisible, after 0.25s instead of 1s.
   * Heartshadow now weakens upon dealing any damage while the damage increase is active.
* We love Worldline Zero's performance, and with all of the attention we've been giving Swords we wanted to spend some time really differentiating it from a certain perk on glowing Sword Dares.

   * The sprinting Heavy attack can now be chained into itself once.

      * Sword guard energy cost from each sprinting heavy attack reduced from 100% to 50%.
      * Decreased damage from an individual sprinting heavy attack by 25%, to compensate.

* Sweet Business's performance is a lot of fun, but we felt we could really plus its fun factor and strength by adding some explosions.

   * Now fires explosive rounds every 20 shots (fewer shots while fully spun up).
* Legend of Acrius hits extremely hard already, dealing some of the highest damage per shot in the game, but its ammo reserves run out fairly quickly, and you have to be right on top of enemies to use it, we've relaxed both of those constraints.

   * Increased total ammo from 12 to 16.
   * Increased maximum projectile distance from 9m to 12m.

* Tommy's Matchbook is all about burning yourself, we've updated it to let you burn others as well.

   * Catalyst updated: While overheated, sustained fire scorches your target. Every 5 shots applies 14+7 (with the Embers of Ashes Fragment) scorch stacks.
* No Time to Explain's drone wouldn't work against Barrier Champion shields when it had an anti-barrier effect, we've fixed that, and also made the drone work with the Feeding Frenzy perk.

   * Updated drone to work with anti-barrier (will break Barrier Champion shields and over penetrate combatant shields).
   * Updated drone to work with Feeding Frenzy (from the NTTE catalyst).
   * This also resolved an issue where the feedback for Feeding Frenzy would always play when the player spawned and then never again.
* Skyburner's Oath's Solar 3.0 pass turned out to be too conservative, so we've brought it up to be more competitive with other scorching options.

   * Increased scorch stacks from 3 to 5 and 5 to 10 with the Embers of Ashes Fragment.
* Salvation's Grip's performance and utility is entertaining and situationally useful, but as a Heavy weapon it really needs to do some damage, without compromising on its identity‚Äîwe've rebuilt its functionality using bowling as inspiration.

   * Reworked to have two firing modes. Charged shot creates a pattern of Stasis crystals (where the number of crystals is no longer dependent on charge time). Uncharged shot is a normal Grenade Launcher shot, which does more damage to Stasis crystals and frozen targets.
   * Added a new perk that reloads the magazine from reserves when you quickly shatter at least 3 crystals with the uncharged shot.

* Bad Juju has always been hard to control, and it turns out that this is because it was originally set up to use Auto Rifle recoil.

   * Fixed an issue that was causing the weapon to recoil like an Auto Rifle, making it harder to control. The recoil pattern will now be similar to other Pulse Rifles.
* Fighting Lion's damage against red bars spiked to massive levels due to a recent bug, we've addressed this‚Äîbut note that it still receives the 40% damage bonus for Exotic Primary weapons.

   * Fixed an issue that was causing this weapon to do more damage than intended to red-bar combatants.
* Thunderlord has surged in popularity with the release of its catalyst and the Season 20 Machinegun buff, but it shipped with a bug that allowed lightning strikes at a higher frequency than intended against Divinity bubbles. We've addressed that‚Äînote that regular crits are not affected by the change.

   * Fixed an issue resulting in hits against a Divinity bubble counting as two crits instead of one.
* Winterbite's initial version included an exploitable damage bug, which is fixed here.

   * The impact damage has been removed and redistributed to the detonation damage.
   * The self-damage scaling has been tuned to account for the increased damage of the detonation.

##Perks


* Fragile Focus is fairly potent, but the perk deactivator was very unforgiving.

   * Bonus lasts until shield pop, returns when shield regenerates to 100%.
* Thresh, Demolitionist, and Pugilist have always granted increased energy on Shotgun, Fusion Rifle and Sniper Rifle kills, but Glaives missed out on that bonus until now.

   * Grants increased energy to Glaive projectile kills (same as Shotguns, Fusion Rifles, and Sniper Rifles).
* Reconstruction has been simplified under-the-hood so that we can place the perk on more weapons without exceeding perk budgets.

   * This results in a slight change to the timing of the perk where the initial timer and the cooldown timer between reloads have been unified.
   * Base perk: 4 seconds.
   * Enhanced perk: 3.5 seconds.
* Shoot to Loot is already situationally useful, but we've been looking for a good way to allow players to interact with Orbs of Power at a distance, and this was an obvious option.

   * Updated to pick up Orbs of Power.
   * Currently this only works on direct hits. The ability for the orbs to be picked up with weapon detonations will be added in a future patch.

##The Future


We‚Äôre in the process of redesigning how zoom interacts with damage falloff. Weapons with that weapon type‚Äôs standard zoom value (e.g., for SMGs this would be 14 zoom stat, or 1.4x magnification) will be unaffected by this specific change, but weapons with lower than standard zoom values for their archetype will have their damage falloff buffed, and weapons with higher than standard zoom values will have their damage falloff reduced. Note that this will only apply to damage falloff. To avoid negatively impacting weapon feel, bonuses to aim assist, accuracy, and recoil will still apply. We will also be making a pass on the base damage falloff ranges for several types of weapons to make sure that weapon types that previously relied on having above standard zoom to be competitive are not left behind.



There‚Äôs also a big Sword update coming, with the goal of making guarding substantially more valuable.



In the more distant future, we‚Äôre working on an update to Sparrows that will allow players to use their favorites instead of Always on Time (without touching AoT itself).",DTG_Bot,1187,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/13k7lh0/season_21_weapon_changes_preview/,change,0.4569266736507416

867,2023-04-29 23:18:40-05:00,AmItheAsshole,WIBTA if I had asked our friend to change her baby‚Äôs diaper in the bathroom?,"I [m22] am married to my pregnant wife [f22] and have been married for almost a year and a half. We found out a couple of weeks ago that she‚Äôs pregnant (which was both planned and hoped for) and by this point she‚Äôs 8 weeks along. Morning sickness is bad and getting worse. 

We have D&amp;D with a few of our college friends, all of which are also married and roughly the same ages as us. We meet every Saturday, 6‚Äì10pm. The group is, as follows (with name changes for privacy):

- Me 
- Wife
- DM
- DM‚Äôs hubby
- Dave (his wife doesn‚Äôt play)
- Mark (his wife doesn‚Äôt play)
- Steve (his wife doesn‚Äôt play)
- Carla (married to Pete)
- Pete (married to Carla)

Carla and Pete had their daughter 8 months ago, and she‚Äôs a very healthy kid. Aside from a few personality differences between me and Pete (that nobody knows except my wife), and the fact that Carla and Pete naturally just haven‚Äôt shown up for the majority of the last year (work reasons and to take care of the kid), the whole group is really close. 

Tonight was the first day that Carla and Pete have showed up in a few months, showing up without letting anyone know. Which is‚Ä¶ fine? I guess? I made dinner for everyone but them because nobody expected them and they didn‚Äôt let us know. They haven‚Äôt been active at all in the group chat that we have, and have been pretty low contact for whatever reason, and so after a few weeks we just stopped including them in the campaign.

Anyway, back to tonight. About an hour in, the kid starts screaming, and I‚Äôm sitting next to Carla and company, so it‚Äôs right in my ear. Not horrible, because I can deal with loud noises, but Carla‚Äôs not even acknowledging it, pretending like nothing‚Äôs going on. Thankfully we hadn‚Äôt yet started the session and were still in the ‚Äúhanging out‚Äù phase, so it wasn‚Äôt detracting from the night, and all was well. 

Some time later, after the session starts, I smell sanitary wipes, and look up and see the top of Carla‚Äôs head over on the floor on the other side of the table. I text my wife (we do this to avoid whispering to each other) about it (M = Me, W = Wife): 

M: ‚Äú‚Ä¶is she changing a diaper on our floor?‚Äù

W: ‚ÄúYeah? Where else?‚Äù

M: ‚Äúliterally somewhere better [like] the bathroom‚Äù

The conversation goes on between us for about 15 minutes, wherein I tell my wife that I think it‚Äôs disrespectful to just use our apartment floor as their own, and I think she should‚Äôve at least asked to use the bathroom. Eventually we reached the ‚Äúconclusion‚Äù that it would be incredibly rude of me to ask that of our friend and that my wife would appreciate mercy with taking care of our kid in inconvenient places. 

TL, DR: Our friend changed her 8 month old on our floor and I told my wife I would‚Äôve rather she asked to use our bathroom. WIBTA to ask our friends to ask to use our bathroom?

Edit for clarification purposes: The apartments we live in have massive countertops in the bathroom that has more than sufficient space for a diaper change.

Please give it a read and share your thoughts!","Hey all,

Some of you may be aware that Reddit [posted an announcement thread today](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/) detailing some serious planned changes to the API. The overview was quite broad causing some folks to have questions about specific aspects. I had two calls with Reddit today where they explained things and answered my questions.

Here's a bullet point synopsis of what was discussed that should answer a bunch of questions. Basically, changes be coming, but not *necessarily* for the worse in all cases, provided Reddit is reasonable.

- Offering an API is expensive, third party app users understandably cause a lot of server traffic
- Reddit appreciates third party apps and values them as a part of the overall Reddit ecosystem, and does *not* want to get rid of them
- To this end, Reddit is moving to a paid API model for apps. The goal is not to make this inherently a big profit center, but to cover both the costs of usage, as well as the opportunity costs of users not using the official app (lost ad viewing, etc.)
- They spoke to this being a more equitable API arrangement, where Reddit doesn't absorb the cost of third party app usage, and as such could have a more equitable footing with the first party app and not favoring one versus the other as as Reddit would no longer be losing money by having users use third party apps
- The API cost will be usage based, not a flat fee, and will *not* require Reddit Premium for users to use it, nor will it have ads in the feed. Goal is to be reasonable with pricing, not prohibitively expensive.
- Free usage of the API for apps like Apollo is not something they will offer. Apps will either need to offer an ad-supported tier (if the API rates are reasonable enough), and/or a subscription tier like Apollo Ultra.
- If paying, access to more APIs (voting in polls, Reddit Chat, etc.) is ""a reasonable ask""
- How much will this usage based API cost? It is not finalized yet, but plans are within 2-4 weeks
- For NSFW content, they were not 100% sure of the answer (later clarifying that with NSFW content they're talking about sexually explicit content only, not normal posts marked NSFW for non-sexual reasons), but thought that it would no longer be possible to access via the API, I asked how they balance this with plans for the API to be more equitable with the official app, and there was not really an answer but they did say they would look into it more and follow back up. I would like to follow up more about this, especially around content hosting on other websites that is posted to Reddit.
- They seek to make these changes while in a dialog with developers 
- This is not an immediate thing rolling out tomorrow, but rather this is a heads up of changes to come
- There was a quote in an article about how these changes would not affect Reddit apps, that was meant in reference to ""apps on the Reddit platform"", as in embedded into the Reddit service itself, not mobile apps 

tl;dr: Paid API coming.

My thoughts: I think if done well and done reasonably, this could be a positive change (but that's a big if). If Reddit provides a means for third party apps to have a stable, consistent, and future-looking relationship with Reddit that certainly has its advantages, and does not sound unreasonable, *provided the pricing is reasonable*.

I'm waiting for future communication and will obviously keep you all posted. If you have more questions that you think I missed, please post them and I'll do my best to answer them and if I don't have the answer I'll ask Reddit.

\- Christian


### Update April 19th

Received an email clarifying that they will have a fuller response on NSFW content available soon (which hopefully means some wiggle room or access if certain conditions are met), but in the meantime wanted to clarify that the updates will only apply to content or pornography material. Someone simply tagging a sports related post or text story as NSFW due to material would not be filtered out.

Again I also requested clarification on content of a more explicit nature, stating that if there needs to be further guardrails put in place that Reddit is implementing, that's something that I'm happy to ensure is properly implemented on my end as well.

Another thing to note is [that just today Imgur banned sexually explicit uploads](https://help.imgur.com/hc/en-us/articles/14415587638029) to their platform, which serves as the main place for NSFW Reddit image uploads, such as r/gonewild (to my knowledge the most popular NSFW content), due to Reddit not allowing explicit content to be uploaded directly to Reddit.",iamthatis,2340,https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/12ram0f/had_a_few_calls_with_reddit_today_about_the/,change,0.4283791184425354

You have law makers who want to make implementing things like autonomous trucks or integrating AI into the service industry illegal for the next 20 years. It‚Äôs quite tiring as we are on the cusp of delegating a large number of tasks that allows us to free up the time of millions of people to pursue a more fulfilling life.

We should be discussing how the economy and society should be prepared to make a fundamental shift. The labor cost saved by implementing these AI and autonomous programs shouldn‚Äôt go straight into the pockets of Wall Street or, at least not all of them. Instead of purposefully implementing roadblocks, we should be discussing a system that collects 70, 75, 80% of the savings from removing the labor force and distributing these first, to the people who are displaced by AI and autonomy and then, eventually, across society on a whole. We should be embracing getting people out of their little cubicle, spending 40 hours a week crunching monotonous numbers under artificial light and not punish them for AI‚Äôs development but, celebrate and compensate them for pursuing something else out of life.

Our school for the past three years has done a digital book where there's a photo of the graduates, our names and the names of our parents (and siblings if you have any). I submitted my form a couple of weeks ago. I listed my mom as mother and my dad as father. My mom died when I was 5 and my dad married my stepmom when I was 8. My dad wanted to change the mother's name to my stepmom's name when he got sent an advanced copy, something all parents can sign up to get. I told him I don't want it changed. That my mom's name should be on there and not my stepmom's. He told me she'll be hurt if she doesn't get named but mom does, since she has been with me throughout most of my school life and that it would be a small thing and listing someone who is actually here to know. He said everyone knows I love my mom but I can and should love my stepmom too and show this kind of appreciation for all she has done for me. He said he didn't say anything about me not naming my stepsiblings. But a line must be drawn about my stepmom.

I told him he is not allowed to change it and that is final and if he does I will speak to the teacher in charge of putting the graduation book together. Dad told me I am being unreasonable and hurting someone for no reason at all.

I know my stepmom would want to be in the book and will be hurt by this. But I will hate her being named as my mother because to me, she is not, and I don't want her to be my mother. She's my stepmom and that's enough.

Dad told me I am very close to being grounded for speaking to him the way I did and for not considering other people's feelings.

I'm on the East Coast of the US and a recruiter reached out. The company is on the West Coast and requires 8-5 their time to be worked. That would mean 11-8 for me. 30% more money, nicer job title, but everything else seems the same as what I'm doing now.

There is something hidden in SWAPS that you aren't allowed to see.

I was wondering how someone might use something called ""corridor swaps"" in order to mitigate price volatility on a single idiosyncratic security.

A corridor swap is: **An interest rate swap where the payment obligation on one side accrues only on days when the reference rate is within a predetermined range or corridor**\- analogous to a range accumulation option or note. This swap is designed to implement a forecast on the volatility, range, or level of interest rates.

This lead me to a discussion on something called ""basis risk"", with a friendly AI.  I wanted to know how one might go about minimizing the basis risk of a corridor swap.

Low and behold, I found this response to be quite compelling.

***Basis risk can arise when the correlation between the underlying asset and the swap instrument is not perfect, and it can be especially pronounced for idiosyncratic securities, or securities with unique characteristics that may not be well-represented by a standardized derivative instrument like a corridor swap. Some strategies to mitigate basis risk on a single idiosyncratic security include:***

1. ***Using a customized swap: Instead of using a standardized corridor swap, investors may work with a financial institution to create a customized swap that is tailored to the specific characteristics of the security. This can help to ensure that the correlation between the underlying asset and the swap instrument is as high as possible.***
2. ***Combining swaps: Investors may use multiple swaps, each with different parameters, in order to more closely match the characteristics of the underlying asset. This can help to mitigate basis risk by ensuring that the investor's exposure is hedged across multiple dimensions.***
3. ***Using options: Options are a type of financial derivative that give investors the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a specified price. By using options in conjunction with a corridor swap, investors can create a more flexible and customizable hedging strategy that can more closely match the unique characteristics of the idiosyncratic security.***
4. ***Diversification: If a single idiosyncratic security is difficult to hedge using corridor swaps or other financial derivatives, investors may choose to diversify their portfolio by investing in a variety of securities with different risk profiles. This can help to reduce overall portfolio risk and mitigate the impact of any single security on the portfolio.***

I'd be lying if I didn't say that it sure fits like a glove...

Custom swaps you say?

2058,2023-05-06 15:06:28-05:00,CPTSDNextSteps,Therapeutic Harm Reduction Suggestions - How your therapist should treat you and how to mitigate iatrogenic harm.," 

I wrote this list of suggestions for my future therapist after having several bad experiences with previous therapists. It started as a personalized list of how I wanted to be treated. These suggestions create safety to do deep trauma recovery work.

* Listen first
* Ask me what I want to talk about
* Validate me first 
* I am the expert on my personal experience and how I choose to analyze it. Validate and hold space first, then offer resources.
* It‚Äôs okay to not have answers. Witness, hold space. Connect to self. Self-leadership is a goal. (IFS terminology).
* Pay attention to my physical expression and nervous system regulation. (Yawns, eye contact, seated position, hand placement, deep breaths, etc.) If I stop looking at you and withdraw, check in with me and what I'm experiencing. (Learn more by looking in to Polyvagal Theory and Somatic work)
* If I show a hint of aggression towards you, default to curiosity and apologize first, then explore our misunderstanding second. An apology doesn‚Äôt mean that you are universally wrong, it just means that you want to create safety in the relationship. That you value the message held by exiles and protectors. (IFS terminology)
* If I say, ‚ÄúWhen you do this, it hurts me.‚Äù Don‚Äôt deny it happened or that it‚Äôs nothing. Even if you don‚Äôt have a memory of doing it, or you think I‚Äôm misinterpreting what happened, still apologize that it happened and say that it wasn‚Äôt your intention and that you‚Äôll be willing to pay attention in the future.
* CBT often results in gaslighting pain. Don't ever challenge me as if you‚Äôre providing tough love. Witnessing is more important. ""It feels like that sometimes."" ""That sounds like a heavy burden."" ""I don't fully understand but I'm curious."" These are all better responses than denying my interpretation of my trauma. Ask what solutions I see and help me brainstorm options. Present ideas as suggestions.
* I usually don‚Äôt like to interrupt people but I‚Äôm learning that I should interrupt when something doesn‚Äôt feel right. Please don‚Äôt take it personal. I will let you know when I feel myself having a negative experience.
* Please feel comfortable expressing your boundaries. I indirectly benefit when you take care of yourself.

Laurence Heller said, ‚ÄúA healthy child protests when they are mistreated.‚Äù In this case, a healthy client communicates when they are having a hard time. If a therapist doesn‚Äôt attune to you, consider it a red flag. A therapist can‚Äôt provide care to you, that they do not provide to themselves. If they can‚Äôt hold space for their own pain, they are less likely to hold space for yours.

One discerning question to ask yourself: Is this pain coming from inside or outside? Am I in pain because my therapist is doing something harmful to me? Or is this pain that is on it‚Äôs way out? Pain that is on it‚Äôs way out feels good because it‚Äôs being witnessed. Pain that is compounding or retraumatizing does not feel better after the distress has passed. You might feel even more sensitive afterwards and willing to fight someone or dissociate. 

Something you can say when your therapist is saying something that hurts. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you're right in some way but this isn‚Äôt landing well for me. I‚Äôd like to work at this from a different angle or try again on a different day.‚Äù You could also say, ‚ÄúI am feeling a protector/anger/dissociation coming up. I think we need to pay attention to that right now.‚Äù 

For ideal trauma recovery, safety is created first before big moves are made. If you do not feel safe and comfortable, and your therapist is trying to make some moves (ex. challenge you), let them know your protectors do not feel secure enough to let things move. Trying to force change and bypass protectors can have negative results, or at minimum create distrust in your psyche.  

One might argue this list is too coddling or self centered. Therapy is about changing the self so it should be self centered. It creates safety to correct ourselves authentically. If it doesn't happen organically from the center of one's consciousness it could potentially reinforce deeply held harmful beliefs such as ""I can't trust myself. I'm inherently broken, and need my savior therapist to fix me."" We don't need tough love. Reality is tough enough.

A statement like, ""You're exhibiting classic signs of codependency. Would you like to explore the research together?"" Is helpful. Letting a client know something they did is abusive is helpful, because they can know the times it happened to them was wrong. There are exceptions and limitations to these suggestions but in general these strategies cultivate self sovereignty and should reduce harm when working with a therapist.",SLCPermaculture,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSDNextSteps/comments/13a0kt3/therapeutic_harm_reduction_suggestions_how_your/,mitigation,0.49209314584732056

""Redeem up to ... 10 gift cards per transaction at NER dot com.  ""

"" The return amount will be credited to your gift card within 30 minutes of the time we receive it. ""

These are all demonstrably false, and led me to the purchase of over $800 in gift cards that I would never have been able to use for the intended purpose- the laptop with shipping included. Gift cards were purchased to the exact amount of the invoice.

My order was cancelled for suspected fraud (it took me over an hour to learn this much). I'd presented ID at the counter when they were purchased. I was eventually told to wait 24 hours for the cards to be verified then I could use them.

The cards were verified, I placed the order again, the cards were accepted, it was set for shipping\*\*- and the order was automatically cancelled a second time\*\*. A rep tried twice to tell me it had been cancelled by my bank, even after I reminded her I'd used NER gift cards purchased at a POS with cash, there was no bank involved.

After over 3 hours, 15+phone calls, 30+ representative, a dozen 'sent back to queue', a couple 'on hold for 10+mnutes then disconnected's and multiple UPSELL ATTEMPTS (bait and switch, ""you sure you can't spend even a penny more?"", "" The system I found is a bit more"", etc) I found a rep that FINALLY told me the truth- that my order would NEVER go through, that it would ALWAYS be cancelled for suspected fraud.

The 30 minute refund still has not happened 19 hours later.

I bought the gift card based wholly upon the promises made on NER dot com, which are factually incorrect:

I could not use the gift cards for NER product at NER dot com

I could not redeem two gift cards on my purchase, let alone ten

A low cost item was presented for sale, an order accepted AND PAID FOR, then cancelled after- twice. There is no possible way to purchase this laptop using NER issued gift cards for delivery online.

I have been told I \*must\* go to a retail location to use these cards to purchase the intended laptop. I am low income, mentally ill, can't drive, and have a large service German Shepherd by my side 24/7. The nearest location is a 3 hour public transit trip, which I cannot afford regardless. The gift cards were purchased specifically for the available system, which was offered with free shipping.

I cannot get so much as a supervisor on the phone, let alone anyone willing to take responsibility for my issue. Corporate executive team is shielded, as are the retail locations- I can't even call a local store GM to plead for help.

Many of us here are software developers, some of the businesses we are working at are already working out AI projects that will start replacing many jobs. 

Some of the jobs that may quickly vanish are some of customer support jobs, some store workers, some fast food workers, the guy at the drive through who takes the orders? Some software developer jobs as well, there will be less demand for jobs like lawyers (we still need lawyers, but 100$ an hour for a consultation that AI can do for free?), some office worker jobs will be lost as well, then education! It is a big thing; it will be affected. 

The list is long.

We will need more people implementing the replacement tech, but the people replaced will be more than the people who are implementing the technology.

Now at one-point things will stabilize, but that will take a few years after that to happen.

My plan is, buy a small house in a rural area with a few acres of land, connected to the internet and electricity, drilled well, electrical heating but also wood heating for emergency.

This is a follow up post but just to recap-

Hose bib broke, house flooded, and roto rooter says they will do plumbing and mitigation then bill the insurance company directly for total amount.

They plan to come out on Monday and cut a 2ft tall hole in the wall around the section where the pipe is, since the drywall will need to be replaced.

They also plan to start ripping up our vinyl plank flooring on Monday, also before insurance adjuster comes out. Our flooring is only 4 yrs old. We were told by roto rooter that they don‚Äôt know how much the job will cost until the start removing flooring to see how far the damage went.

We have continuous flooring throughout our downstairs, about 900 sq ft, and 75% of it was flooded.

We were told there‚Äôs a possibility that the full amount that roto rooter bills our insurance company will not be covered. 

Roto rooter recommended that we do not accept the check from the adjuster, because it‚Äôs usually less than what the repairs will cost. But also told us if they bill insurance and insurance won‚Äôt cover the full amount, we are responsible for difference and have to pay roto rooter out of pocket. 

* Do we let roto rooter do the work, and then bill the insurance company, and hope that it‚Äôs covered? OR do we accept the check from the adjuster, then find a contractor that will work within that check amount? *

I should state that we have used it recreationally, like a long night out or concert, together. And I don't mind doing that here and there. But lately, the last few months he has been using it to treat his symptoms. He was recently prescribed Adderall but our local pharmacies are out -- doctor also prescribed consorta due to the shortage, yet the pharmacies near him don't have that either. So we're waiting to hopefully get it soon.

I've voiced my concerns about him doing it so frequently. Just last week I told him I don't trust his boundaries with the drug (I've seen adverse affects on him in the past, since it's so highly addictive).

The sad part is... I like who he becomes when he's on it. He's attentive, calm, gets things done, proactive. But I'm sad because of obvious reasons- it's a potent addictve drug, has negative affects on overall health. When I spoke to him last week he apologized and said I was right. I want him to deal with his symptoms in healthy ways. Like exercise, eating right, establishing a schedule, etc.

I'm also incredibly irked at his roommate. His roommate buys coke, whenever it's in the house it's typically because of him. He thinks it's not an issue to use it, but he also has better boundaries with the drug than my bf. I caught them doing it last night. My bf is an adult responsible for his decisions, but it doesn't help to have a 'friend' like his roommate. My bf slept on the couch after I forwarded him an apologetic text message he sent me just last week when I was, again, upset with him for coke use. I worry that these are the behaviors of an addict, and I don't know what to say or how to help him. I'm seeking advice on how to help him, or what sort of boundaries to try to put in place.

TL;DR! I've spoken to my bf multiple times about his cocaine use scares me about our future together. He uses it as an easy-to-get way of managing adhd. It does help. But it's not worth the overall health effects. How can I support him?",Ok_Resolution_4059,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/12pqizb/my_30f_bf_34m_uses_coke_to_mitigate_adhd_symtomps/,mitigation,0.44241276383399963

2257,2023-05-20 23:50:23-05:00,TrueFilm,Blood Meridian is getting a movie adaptation. If you didn't know now you know.,"So Cormac McCarthy's western novel *Blood Meridian, or, The Evening Redness in the West* is getting a movie adaptation, directed by John Hillcoat (director of *The Proposition,* a Western film set in Australia, *The Road*, an adapation of another of McCarty's works, and a promo film for *Red Dead Redemption*.)

Some people have been complaining that Hillcoat isn't the guy that should be up for this task. Many have said that the director of *Blood Meridian: The Movie* should've been PTA or Malick. Personally I think Bela Tarr should've been the one to take the reins but idk what he's up to now.

As anyone who's read the book knows, a lot of *Blood Meridian*'s genius comes from its prose and McCarthy descriptive writing, its focus on the horrific violence of the American frontier, and its larger-than-life characters like Judge Holden. Because of this, many believe that the book can't be adapted into a movie, despite what McCarthy himself has said. Me personally I think it could be adapted as McCarthy's writing usually focuses a lot on grand landscapes that could be well put on screen, as seen in *No Country For Old Men* and casting shouldn't be difficult as long as the actors understand each character precisely.

The one issue really is the violence. I can't think of any mainstream piece of work that has the same level of graphic violence that *Blood Meridian* shows and I'm not sure something like the MPAA would allow a high-budget film to include babies impaled on tree branches. And the violence should be shown for the horrible thing it is, not in some slasher flick way like in the *Terrifier* movies. The worst thing that could happen to this adaptation is that the studio executives market the movie this way.

I read all of Elmore Leonard's books and I'm always surprised at how many movie fans don't know who he was. His influence is all over Tarentino's work, especially in Reservoir Dogs and Pulp fiction. Without Leonard you don't get ""Royal with cheese.""

What is the best adaptation of Elmore Leonard""s work?

For me, it's ""Out of Sight"" but ""Get Shorty"" and ""Jackie Brown"" are close. The scene in the trunk in ""Out of Sight"" is perfect and the whole movie just sings. The cast is incredible (Cheetle! Zahn! Brooks! Guzman! all in supporting roles!), and the scene in the bar with the snow is one of my favorite seduction scenes of all time.

Trivia: Michael Keaton has the distinction of playing the same character in two different Leonard movies by different studios: Out of Sight and Jackie Brown.

BTW - ""Stick"" with Burt Reynolds and ""52 Pickup"" with Roy Schreider were also Leonard books. Bea Bridges had a short lived series based on ""Maximum Bob.""",RompaStompa07,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/13k5o8f/best_elmore_leonard_adaptation/,adaptation,0.4494363069534302
2352,2023-05-12 11:13:57-05:00,Rings_Of_Power,"A little bit more about the ""It's an adaptation"" lie. Numenor","This is inspired by u/Separate_Code_2725 's comment pointing out how dirty the series did the Numenoreans. Their comment is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rings_Of_Power/comments/136lked/lord_of_the_rings_rings_of_power_season_2_delayed/jit4gox/?context=3) . 

So let's think, is the \*re-imagining\* of Numenor we were presented with an adaptation or not? No adaptation is 100% accurate after all. 

1. The mightiest military power of Men doesn't have a single squad that knows sword fighting, so someone must show them (""Fight with your feet"" I literally howled)
2. Nor does it have prison guards that could uhm you know guard a prison
3. Nor does it have a single ship that would look like a warship; ""fishing boats"" is what their ships really look like
4. BUT those ships apparently have a giant hidden compartment to carry hundreds of horses and cavalrymen 
5. BUT the horses are super strong and are able to cover thousands of miles in one day and arrive to the battle still fresh and not tired at all (same with the cavalrymen, checkmate naysayers)

Now, to the inner logic of Numenor's existence, rebellion, and inherent reasons for its downfall

The Edain that fought Morgoth were given the island to live and thrive. They won one of the greatest wars and were rewarded. In the show, Miriel says (rephrasing) ""We weren't gifted this place; we bought every inch of it with our blood"". This can't be more wrong.

1. Rewarding loyalty isn't the same as buying it. The former is appreciation, the latter is hiring/bribing. They weren't mercenaries and fought for freedom not for a payment. 
2. Skewing the narrative by ""we bought it"" as in ""we sacrificed for it"" means it was an exchange kept in mind when fighting. It wasn't the case.
3. The mere existence of Numenor is a declaration of peace, friendship, and mutual respect between the Men, the Elves, and the Valar

""They will take our jobs!"" conflict vs. the lore conflict. Okay, there's a large consensus about it so no comments needed. 

So once again, an adaptation, however new, fresh, and groundbreaking, MUST follow the main points of the adapted material. Like, we can make Sherlock Holmes our young contemporary, but he will still be a detective. 

1. Portraying a mighty empire as a bunch of helpless fucks does NOT follow the point of the books. Making ships have a supernatural cargo capacity and horses apparently able to fly isn't the trick you think it is.
2. Portraying the whole deal of Numenor's existence as ""bought by blood"" does NOT follow the very important point of the books.
3. ""They will take our jobs"" does NOT follow ANYTHING in the books and whoever wrote this line must go to their room and think about what they've done.

ROP is NOT an adaptation.

2370,2023-04-18 14:42:17-05:00,MacroFactor,Persistent metabolic adaptation &amp; set point weight range,"Hi! New MacroFactor user here! I've been seeing a lot of content about how our metabolisms work recently and had some questions.

I recently read the [Reverse Dieting: Hype Versus Evidence](https://macrofactorapp.com/reverse-dieting/) article and some of the relevant conclusions I've gathered from it is that: (1) your metabolic rate can't be ""damaged"", (2) metabolic adaptation happens if you are in an energy deficit and/or have lost fat, and (3) that metabolic adaptation is completely reversed once you are no longer in an energy deficit and have gained all of the fat mass back.

However, recently on Tiktok I've been seeing claims that your body ""remembers"" repeated diets and lowers your metabolic rate (more than it would have during your first diet) because it doesn't know you're on a diet and instead thinks you're starving. And that if after ""excessive"" dieting attempts, you gain the weight back and more, then you've increased your set point weight. They also claim you cannot *lower* your set point weight and that if you try to lose weight, you'll essentially be forever stuck fighting a really slow metabolism with super low calories in order to maintain. These claims came from an MS RDN and this is the link to the video I'm drawing from: [https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTR3EruKv/](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTR3EruKv/).

It seems strange to me that increasing your set point weight is possible but lowering it is not? She also basically claims that you're healthiest at your set point range but what if you've increased your set point weight range by a lot? Also, the body doesn't actually remember diets/""starvation"" right? Your metabolic rate lowers any time you are in an energy deficit/lose fat whether it's the first or fifth time you try dieting, right? Does the adaptation rate actually increase on successive dieting attempts from the *same* starting weight (and assuming the same amount of fat mass)? Or is she misled?

I was also recently listening to the Maintenance Phase podcast's Biggest Loser episode and they also mention a [study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/oby.21538) that was done on some of the show's contestants that concluded ""that despite substantial weight regain in the 6 years following participation in ‚ÄúThe Biggest Loser‚Äù, RMR remained suppressed at the same average level as at the end of the weight loss competition."" This was interpreted by the hosts to mean that the show had permanently damaged the metabolisms of the contestants. Assuming the substantial weight regain involved gaining back most of the fat they had lost on the show, why would they have a significantly lower BMR still? Can it all be attributed to continued fat loss attempts of being in an energy deficit for years after? I don't think the study mentions if they continued to diet but they did weigh them daily for 2 weeks before taking their measurements and the resulting mean weight of the group trended downwards. To me, it seems reasonable to assume then that at least some of them continued dieting after the show. So then is the explanation that they've been in a deficit for so long, their metabolism has adapted so much that the deficit is now their new maintenance and that's why they have a lower BMR? Is that even possible if they gained most of the weight back? How would they go about reversing this metabolic adaptation if they are no longer in an energy deficit and have gained back the lost fat? Do my questions even make sense? What's the explanation for these results? ü§î

The absolute tragedy of Johnny's life, and love, ripped from him by a car accident is maybe a mundane, everyday kind of horror. Most of us probably know,  or know of someone that knows someone, that was in a serious car wreck/left disabled in some way.

And in today's world of serial killer documentaries consumed like reality fodder, the intertwined dread of young girls violated maybe might seem pedestrian. 

But the 'blessing' Johnny received whilst in a coma - the dead zone - the ability to see the future of people he touches, along with the political element that comes to the fore is where this film makes you sit up. It's as human and pertinent today as it ever was.

Christopher Walken is our protagonist in a fairly restrained but stunning performance. Well, he has his moments  - The ice, is gonna, *BREAK* - but they're glorious. And, imho, this is a rare occasion where King truly sticks the landing.

2495,2023-05-10 18:10:19-05:00,AmItheAsshole,AITA For Asking My Parents To Pay For My Vow Renewal If They Pay For My Sister‚Äôs Second Wedding?,"My (37F) sister (40F)  is having a second wedding this upcoming summer. Her first wedding was nearly 15 years ago as she married her college boyfriend when she was 25 and they divorced five years later. My sister didn‚Äôt talk at the time about why the marriage ended but came out as a lesbian a number of years later.  

She began dating her current partner five years ago. She is lovely and seems like a great match for my sister.  I am genuinely happy for them and wish them the best. But here is where the conflict comes in, as soon as my sister announced that she and her partner are  getting legally married our parents jumped on the opportunity to plan and pay for the wedding. My sister and her partner can more than easily pay for it but my parents insist on paying for it for ‚Äúthe principle of the matter‚Äù.  

I believe this insistence is largely a way for them to try to make up to my sister how they handled her sexuality in the past. My parents have become far more liberal in recent years but were heavily involved in the church when we were growing up. I didn‚Äôt know this at the time but my parents took my sister to some conversion therapy type program when she first tried to come out to them as a teenager. They now feel bad about this and try to make it up to her.

Despite this I think it is unfair that my sister is getting a second wedding paid for when I have only gotten one. I tried to bring this up to my parents by asking if they would pay for my husband and I‚Äôs vow renewal to make it even. They got mad at me and said I was being ridiculous and selfish at a time that should be about my sister.

Ever since the conception of this sub, we've dealt with floods of reposts. We‚Äôre sure you‚Äôre familiar with them. Many are for important issues that are shared by the entire player base, while others are just for personal requests and desires for the game. The [Bungie Plz](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/wiki/bungieplz) was shortly implemented after conception as a central ""wish-list"" for all that we, the community, desired. It is *completely* user driven. With rare exceptions, nearly all submissions are sent in by you, the users of this subreddit!

However, just like Destiny 2, our wiki article began to experience problems as it grew over time. It's been getting just a few sizes too big. We understand that the continued addition of topics has begun to encroach on your ability to continue the conversation towards matters that mean the most to you, and even though [the Bungie Plz has seen so many successes over the years, **with well over 100 officially implemented game suggestions and desires**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/wiki/bungieplz#wiki_completed_in_destiny_2.21), there's still dozens upon dozens of retired topics that haven't seen the light of day for many months...even years!

---

Every Sunday, this thread will focus on a certain retired Bungie Plz topic **of your choosing, voted by the users.** We will curate a list of 5 suggestions to help focus your voting process, **but you get the final say** on what is talked about each week. By all means, if one topic is overwhelmingly desired despite not being part of those 5 items we picked, then we'll be happy to go with that one. Our curated list is only to help you focus the conversation. The only stipulation is that the topic must be new every week. This thread is for the entirety of the Bungie Plz wiki, so no back-to-back voting!

Think of these threads as a way to keep the spark alive, and to bring old topics up to fresh light. For example, do we still want to move Queenbreaker to the special slot? Or does Arbalest serve that purpose well enough now? Do we still want an all-black shader, or do we want to bring back Prismatic Matrix?

You tell us! This is your conversation, guardians.

For this week, you voted on:

# Buff Renewal Grasps

For next week, here are some suggestions:

* Reissue Season of Dawn weapons 
* Let us apply shaders to exotic weapons
* Please improve the Postmaster 
* Sell Exotic ornaments through Xur

Sound off in the sticky comment for which one sounds good, or [anything else in the Bungie Plz wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/wiki/bungieplz) that catches your eye, and we'll do our best to accommodate!

2. I do not live in an English speaking country

I (23F) had a longterm sub position at a school in my city parallel to my master studies (I am studying so be a teacher). I had 4 classes since the beginning of the school year. 

My contract ends in two and a half weeks and then there will be 5 more weeks until summer holidays. 
Prior to the Easter vacation admin told me I was definitely staying and getting a renewed contract until summer holidays. 

Well last week it turned out it won‚Äôt be renewed because of reasons (like there is no  actual reason). 

I am sad about it and I told my students that I would no longer be there and when my contract will end exactly so they can plan ahead. 

I actually am on good terms with all 4 classes but 2 of them seem to like me really really really much. 
When I told them they said it‚Äôs not fair and that they want to keep me. 
I said ‚ÄûI also want to keep you but it‚Äôs not my decision but I am happy to have met you.‚Äú

Well a few kids decided to make it their decision and told their parents. A good handful of students and parents went to admin and told them what they thought about this ‚Äûnot-renewing‚Äú my contract. 

I received a bitter mail from admin that it was unprofessional to tell the students and was told from a teacher that is close to admin, that it‚Äôs as an AH move of me.

I'm just so very disappointed in you two.' 

Then he rubs it in. 'You both knew I work on complex machines like this for days, and yet you didn't show any respect. You know how fragile and dangerous these are, but you just started clicking buttons anyway. I've always treated the both of you with the utmost respect, and look at what you did here.'

Let Grian get out an anguished 'Dooooooc!' and Scar start babbling 'sorrysorrysorrysorrysorry'. Let them stew in the absolute worst feeling a Dad can create... *disappointment*. 

Then, he says brightly, 'I know **exactly** how you two can make it up to me!' 

""First, you install Lightmatica. Then, install the schematic I sent you on Discord, and I'll show you how it all works from there."" Grian and Scar's shoulders slump. Their characters don't, of course, but they both make sad little noises that show they know what's coming.

""Now, we ALL rebuild the entire tunnel bore, from scratch, together."" 

*Collective groans.* Cue time lapse.

THAT would be justice. Forcing Grian and Scar to run through the painstaking process of getting all the dispensers and observers right would be absolute *torture* for them. It would guarantee they would never mess with any of his contraptions ever again. 

And Doc would demonstrate 'good Dad' energy in the best possible way.

3043,2023-04-18 14:05:38-05:00,PubTips,[Discussion] Current Market Trends and Sustainability in Publishing - LBF23 Day 1,"Since there have been a few post about marketability in the last few weeks, I decided to post the following article:

&gt;[https://www.thebookseller.com/features/london-book-fair-2023-agents-hotlists](https://www.thebookseller.com/features/london-book-fair-2023-agents-hotlists)

**\*\*Disclaimer:** you might need a subscription to The Bookseller to see the full article. If you register you are able to view a limited number of articles, but I am not sure if this one is included. For those with no access the article mentions current trends, followed by a very long list of books, authors and pitches by agency. It looks a little like Pitch Wars Pitches, and I'm assuming it's for editors to browse easier. Most of the books on the list have already had some rights sold. This is potentially a very good resource to find agencies and agents (especially in the UK), however The Bookseller subscription is about ¬£16 a month and I don't think you should invest it just for this article alone, especially if you are just starting out.

Phew. That being said, I want to draw attention over the trends at LBF23 according to this article:

&gt;Top tips for scripts at London Book Fair 2023.¬†Romantasy, LGBTQ+ themes, ""destination"" thrillers and science‚Äîparticularly evolution‚Äîare the leading trends at Olympia this year.¬†

LGBTQ+ themes are quite popular in the UK atm, and the most recent issue of The Bookseller is mostly about LGBTQ+ books (as opposed I guess to the US where a lot of book bans are happening).

For those who can see the article it is quite interesting to go through the ""agents' hotlist"" and what regions are buying what books.

I would also underline the fact that trends might be different in the UK and US. So while this might be in line with the UK market, a lot of US agents and publishers (and publishers outside of UK/US/English Speaking countries) do participate.

And of course, while these trends are ""hot"" we writers should keep in mind that they do change quite fast, and sometimes it's better to write what calls to us than chasing these ""waves"". However, it it extremely wonderful that LGBTQ+ stories are being promoted to this degree. I hope we get to see more diversity and change within publishing.

And speaking of change, I want to post the following article too:

&gt;[https://www.thebookseller.com/news/soa-launches-campaign-to-help-authors-discuss-their-books-sustainability-with-publishers](https://www.thebookseller.com/news/soa-launches-campaign-to-help-authors-discuss-their-books-sustainability-with-publishers)

It seems that sustainability in publishing was a bit topic at LBF this year. While I am keen to see how this will play out, I am also worried on the effects on authors especially midlist or smaller authors.

&gt;Questions include: ‚ÄúDo you plan to use 100% recycled paper, or otherwise sustainably source the paper used for packaging, books (where possible) and across your operations? Have you stopped using plastic packaging?‚Äù and ‚ÄúDo you use foils and finishes or lamination? What proportion of these can be recycled? Do you offer more sustainable formats such as trimmed sizes?‚ÄùThe SoA says the answers will ‚Äúprovide a clear snapshot of how sustainable a publisher‚Äôs practices are today and, most importantly, what plans and structures it is putting in place to improve that‚Äù and that the campaign ‚Äúcapitalises on authors‚Äô unique position in the industry"".

More information on SoA work on sustainability in publishing can be found here:

&gt;[https://www2.societyofauthors.org/2023/04/18/tree-to-me/](https://www2.societyofauthors.org/2023/04/18/tree-to-me/)

That's me back to ~~procrastinating~~ editing my book the millionth time.

&amp;#x200B;

*edit: I myself am queer and don't like how LGBTQ+ theme are a ""hot"" item at the moment and put out as a trend. As I've observed within publishing, some marginalisation or other is always considered a trend, check box, etc but this doesn't ever bring real change in publishing. As others have commented most stories are edited to appeal white cis het people, advances are smaller, the marketing received is less and most marginaliside creators are not lead titles. However, LGBTQ+ (as well as other marginalisations) have not had the same movements within publishing in the UK as in US, and I would much rather see a full issue of The Bookseller promoting LGBTQ+ books, rather than have people actively try to ban them. I've posted the articles above both about trends and sustainability as I found them interesting, and good resources for authors.* ",Aggravating-Quit-110,79,https://www.reddit.com/r/PubTips/comments/12r0if6/discussion_current_market_trends_and/,sustainability,0.47343727946281433

Now the majority of people playing it have wasted time and resources to a mid-league nerf that wasn‚Äôt even due to a bug or unintended mechanics, on a skill that isn‚Äôt even that good.","For context, twisters could be triggered 30.303 times per second, this isn‚Äôt anything new, but with Triggerbots it gets doubled. When applying poison stacks and curse on hit, this quickly put a huge burden on the servers.

GGG hotfixed this by adding a 100ms cooldown to the skill, effectively giving it 67% less damage. Now the only way to make the skill even somewhat playable is to run ungodly amounts of CDR, realistically getting us to 15 casts per second, a 50% nerf after more investment into gearing.

The biggest problem with this change is that it forces the skill onto Saboteur only because of needing Triggerbots and the 30% CDR nodes. This completely bricks all other build ascendancy choices we‚Äôve used in the past, namely Inquisitor (which was given a Build of the Week video recently) Assassin, and Chieftain, but a quick search on PoE Ninja suggests 7 other ascendancies were playing this skill and probably can no longer justify it.

I know that this isn‚Äôt a very popular build, but it‚Äôs been my favorite since ultimatum, and this sets a precedent that GGG can make a mistake and then dumpster your build mid-league because they‚Äôre too lazy to solve their problem with a balanced approach that keeps the skill playable.

3065,2023-05-11 10:11:08-05:00,TrueUnpopularOpinion,"Bombings like Dresden, Tokyo, Hiroshima, and Nagasaki were both necessary in ending WWII and justified as they drastically reduced the amount of Allied causalities that would have been sustained otherwise","World War Two was a war of strategic bombings. It was just the nature of that war. To expect the Allies to not use that strategy is to willing throw hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of more lives away fighting the Axis powers.

There's a lot of people, on and off reddit, that argue these were unnecessary warcrimes, that Allied generals should've been hung for ordering them, and in some extreme cases that they are equal to Axis actions in the same timeframe. When pressed on what could've been done differently their argument is only ever ""not bomb the people bombing you"". They also willfully ignore the military significance of these targets, whether it be the factories producing arms, rail yards being used to transport men and material, military headquarters in said cities, or harbor in said cities acting as bases for naval forces of the respective nations.

Even the idea of ""denying the german industry workers"", a justification sometimes thrown around for places like Dresden, is logical. German industry was very good at repairing itself with many bombed factories being returned to production of war materials within days if not hours. If you can't destroy the factory your next best option is to deny it the people who produce the goods. People, especially skilled laborers, are a hell of a lot harder to replace than factory structures and the (1940's era) machinery used in said production.

I'm sure there are people that disagree with my points that will so this so to you I ask: what honestly should've been done instead? Precision guided munitions weren't really a thing at this point in time outside of a few relatively ineffective wonderwaffens. The people killed, tanks and planes prevented from being produced, and fuel burned all saved Allied lives. World War One proved this. 

Disclaimer: there may already be a post about this up but I don't know that there is. Either way I feel it's an important conversation and most people in the ""Allied warcrimes"" camp have no realistic alternatives to strategic bombings.",screen-lt,207,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/13eq68m/bombings_like_dresden_tokyo_hiroshima_and/,sustainability,0.450852632522583

I'm a current Parsons student in the Strategic Design and Management program. I am working on a business plan project for a class I am taking. Our team's class project idea is have a sustainable business that take furniture that is broken/damaged/not selling/returns from showrooms and furniture stores to restore/renovate and sell. The goal is to keep pieces from landfills.

If anyone has experience in the furniture industry, do you think furniture stores would give away damaged goods to keep them out of landfills? Our teacher wants us to ask this question to a few industry people this week to test out the assumption of this idea. Any other thoughts you have about ""end of life"" for furniture products would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time!

3218,2023-04-23 16:35:39-05:00,Genshin_Lore,The Sustainer Sacrificed Herself to Stop Forbidden Knowledge from Spreading," When the cataclysm hit 500 years ago, a huge wave of dark monsters along with forbidden knowledge were released from the abyss. The cataclysm was massive enough to take the lives of almost 3 archons. If the impact was so huge that the seven Archons and the Sustainer of Heavenly Principles were sent to deal with it, then wouldn't it be possible for the Sustainer to be corrupted as a consequence?

The theory I wanted to make is that the Sustainer is corrupted by Forbidden Knowledge. Now this could be a crack theory but let's go on as there are some hints in the opening cutscene.

We did see the Sustainer 500 years ago when the Cataclysm took place, so it's not far-fetched to assume that Celestia may have sent her to take care of the Forbidden Knowledge and the Abyss along with all the archons. It is possible that she was either corrupted or tried to absorb the Forbidden Knowledge herself and got corrupted as a result.

(If we go further and assume that the Sustainer is the Shade of Eonothem/Void then it would make sense why she would try to absorb it because she is absorbing it into a void but this is just speculation and can be ignored)

The Sustainer of Heavenly Principles should be on the side of, well, Heavenly Principles(aka Celestia). Then based on what we know and what colours mihoyo uses to portray the divine, her powers should be either blue like the sky nails or golden/yellow. But instead, she uses red cubes. This is strange because red is almost always depicted as corruption(of Forbidden Knowledge) in the game. Although abyssal power is purple, corruption by the forbidden knowledge is depicted by red.

# Uses of colour Red

**1)Durin's eyes and Dvalin's tears**

In the story quest where Venti talks about Dvalin, there is a scene that shows Dvalin facing Durin and Durin's eyes are red in that cutscene and based on what we know, Durin seemed to corrupted. Later, Dvalin who got corrupted by Durin's blood, shed/dropped a corrupted crystal tear at the beginning of the game which was once again red in colour. I suspect that they were corrupted by Forbidden Knowledge.

**2) Corrupted Akasha System**

In the Sumeru archon quest, we see an Eremite who used a Divine Capsule corrupted by Forbidden Knowledge and his Akasha system turned red to depict corruption.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**3)Withering**

Not much to explain here, the Withering is caused due to Forbidden Knowledge and is red in colour.

&amp;#x200B;

**4) Irminsul, Red Cubes and the Sky**

This part is important to note. When the Traveller first encounters the Irminsul, the sky is dyed red along with the Sustainer's cubes. And we know the reason is that the Irminsul was infected with Forbidden Knowledge. A lot of us speculated that the Sustainer may be somewhat responsible for it but the sky later clears up when the forbidden knowledge has finally gone. We see the sky return to normal when we return to that place in Sumeru's Interlude quest. This may prove that the cubes and the red sky are also related to Forbidden Knowledge and not only the Sustainer. This is the one detail that makes me believe she is corrupted and it is not just a colour scheme.

&amp;#x200B;

**5) Eleazar**

Eleazar is the result of forbidden knowledge released by Deshret. In the cutscene where the forbidden knowledge is removed from the Irminsul, there is a scene of Dunyazard's Eleazar being cured. When the scales on her hand vanish, they turn red before disappearing.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't remember more instances of the colour being used but now that we've somewhat established the uses of the colour red, let's review the opening cutscene where the Sustainer and the siblings clashed with each other and take a proper look at the powers she uses.

&amp;#x200B;

**1)The Sustainer's Hand**

Her left hand, unlike her right hand, looks like it's ""corrupted"" by some power. In the video, it actually moves around a bit and it looks like a glitch. (What if she's absorbing the forbidden knowledge in herself to stop Teyvat from getting destroyed?)

**2)The Stars behind her**

There are two ""stars"" she summons when standing behind her, one is golden but the other looks like it's getting stained by red. The corruption may have only partially consumed her at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qr658z8rcpva1.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5f8670248e813f6d06bce83192d9943ac3c1f625

**3)The Cubes**

When she chases the siblings with the cubes, there are brief moments where her cubes are golden/yellow before turning dark red. If you continue watching, the end of the huge line of cubes chasing them look slightly golden too.

&amp;#x200B;

**4)Sibling Trapped in the Cube.**

Because our Traveller has shown to be able to purify Dvalin's tears and has a strong resistance to forbidden knowledge, it is plausible that the sibling trapped in the cube pushed out the corruption and revealed the original colour or atleast a colour similar to the original colour of the Sustainer's cubes(golden) which made the Sustainer pause for a moment to stare at it.

&amp;#x200B;

**5)A Short Instance where She actually does use Golden**

&amp;#x200B;

# Sustainer's Hair, Eyes and Original Clothing

Now this is speculation about what I think the Sustainer originally was like.

The glow of an Archon's eyes and the ends of their hair(at least for the four we have right now) always matches the colour of their element and while Mihoyo doesn't have to strictly follow it, I believe the Sustainer's original power's colour matched the glow of her eyes. And her cape, though galaxy red now may have been golden before her corruption.

Adding on to all that, there is another line that may match well with this theory of the Sustainer getting corrupted. It is a line in the Traveller's profile in character details.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**The keeper is fading away**; the creator has not yet come.  
But the world shall burn no more for you shall ascend.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure if the Chinese version says Sustainer but either way, the word Keeper is a good substitute for Sustainer. They are quite interchangeable in the title ""Sustainer of Heavenly Principles"".

Perhaps the line meant that the Sustainer is fading/dying due to absorbing too much forbidden knowledge.",Lemonteaarts,72,https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Lore/comments/12wr30v/the_sustainer_sacrificed_herself_to_stop/,sustainability,0.41779688000679016

3634,2023-05-05 16:50:06-05:00,Genshin_Impact,"A bunch of words about off-field Pyro, Dehya, and Melt Ganyu","ITT: I spent way too much time and resources experimenting with Dehya and Ganyu and I'll be damned if I don't tell *someone* the results.

The tl;dr is that Dehya + Nahida makes easy, not-tied-to-burst, off-field Pyro an actual thing for Cryo characters. You'll want a Sacrificial Greatsword and/or Dehya C2 for the smoothest rotations.

\---

I'll start by talking about the pain of off-field Pyro. By 3.0's release, if you wanted consistent off-field Pyro as far as I know the main options were:

* Xiangling's burst
* Thoma's burst + your on-field character doing some NAs
* Yoimiya's burst
* Bennett + Jean's bursts
* Kazuha/Venti/Sucrose infusing their bursts with Pyro

Using these in a smooth rotation typically required a shitload of ER, specific positioning, and/or timing. It wasn't impossible, but it was a lot more hoops to jump through than Kokomi/Fischl pressing E. As for why, this is speculation but I think it's because the balancing team is scared of forward Vaporize. Any source of off-field Pyro was kneecapped so Hydro DPS wouldn't completely destroy the game, because god forbid a single-player PvE game let the player feel *too* strong.

It's possible they were afraid of reverse Melt too, but if so that's changed as I'll get into later.

https://preview.redd.it/w3v9zfguy2ya1.jpg?width=575&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2d203104487ef5fcd20857fad6cb5b42e5b7d156

3.0 brought Dendro, and with it on-demand access to (a nerfed) Burning. Now as long as you had Pyro and Dendro, you could have off-field Pyro! ...Except the most accessible source of Dendro at the time, Dendro MC's burst, exploded when it touched Pyro.

Skip to 3.2 and Nahida comes out. How does she change things with her crazy Dendro application?

https://reddit.com/link/1392kfh/video/ftxtijyuz2ya1/player

Not much. The damage from Burning doesn't count as a reaction, so it won't trigger her skill. You'll need another reaction, and your choices are:

* Vaporize: immediately extinguishes Burning
* Overload: can extinguish Burning
* Melt: probably won't extinguish Burning
* Swirl: probably won't extinguish Burning
* Crystallize: probably won't extinguish Burning

If you're familiar with [elemental gauge theory](https://library.keqingmains.com/combat-mechanics/elemental-effects/elemental-gauge-theory), this makes sense. Burning is 1 unit of Pyro aura. Forward Vaporize has a x2 multiplier, so even a tiny 0.5 unit of Hydro would erase Burning. Overload has a x1 multiplier, so results vary depending on how much Electro you apply. And reverse Melt, Swirl, and Crystallize have x0.5 multipliers, so you'd have to go pretty hard to extinguish Burning. It's more complicated than that, since there's also decay to think about, but I'm not here to explain gauge theory to you. ^(I don't even fully get it myself.)

None of it matters anyways because Burning's going out on its own. After about 2 seconds, Burning wears off. If you want to keep the fire going you need to continually apply both Dendro and Pyro. Nahida provides the Dendro, but unless your on-field character is Pyro you need an off-field source of Pyro. That's right, to effectively use this off-field source of Pyro you need to already have an off-field source of Pyro.

(Being fair here, even back in 3.2 Burning made keeping a Pyro aura on an enemy easier. It just didn't solve the ""have a burst ready or get out"" problem.)

Skip to 3.5 and Dehya comes out with an infamously janky kit. But her skill is an off-field source of Pyro. Is she the missing piece of the puzzle?

[Note: My Dehya is at C2.](https://reddit.com/link/1392kfh/video/pfigr8x4w2ya1/player)

Yes, if you use Cryo. With Dehya and Nahida, Cryo characters can reverse Melt all day. Even in a stress test like this clip, Burning is up almost the entire time. So far in my tests, I've only seen Burning go out too fast when I use Ayaka's burst.

https://reddit.com/link/1392kfh/video/h7l92sy7x2ya1/player

Electro has it tougher since you get maybe two Overloads before Burning goes out. At least while the Pyro aura is gone you can react with the Dendro for Quicken and its follow-ups.

https://reddit.com/link/1392kfh/video/3c21zc6jy2ya1/player

Last and least, Hydro snuffs out the fire immediately with a forward Vaporize. Then it's nothing but Blooms until Dehya's skill goes off again. You're better off building Dehya for Burgeon in this setup, assuming the enemy isn't too big.

This is more speculation, but I'd say the reason why Dehya's kit is so clunky is that she got double taxed. The balance team seems to overvalue defensive options (see: Qiqi's cooldowns, original Zhongli having his shield and nothing else, Kokomi getting slapped with no crit, etc) *and* is afraid of off-field Pyro. Thoma was in a similar situation, and I think some of you remember how much he got dunked on at release. But while Thoma could be balanced/kneecapped with an 80 EN burst, Dehya's off-field Pyro comes from her skill. And I guess to the balance team, having an off-field source of Pyro on skill was so powerful that the rest of Dehya needed to be balanced/kneecapped to make up for it.

I think if you look at Dehya solely from the perspective of Burning, her kit makes more sense.

* Her skill only goes off every 2.5 seconds to sync with Nahida.
* She absorbs damage from the on-field character because Burning enemies can damage you if you're too close.
* Her burst is so long and weak because it's actually just +4 seconds to her skill's ability to keep Burning going. Depending on her constellations and equipment you might not even need that, which is why you can cancel it at will and use it to reposition the field instead.

And if you get her to C2, which in recent times has become the dolphin bait constellation, you're rewarded with almost perfect uptime on her skill. Useless from an interruption resistance standpoint since the constellation doesn't extend her A1 passive duration, but useful from a ""keep the Burning going"" perspective.

So what am I saying here, then? Is Dehya secretly good? No, because she does only one thing and is getting powercrept as soon as the devs get the stick out of their asses about off-field Pyro. But right now she's the comfiest option for off-field Pyro... if you consider needing two 5 star characters (one an archon at that) and only being able to support Cryo as comfy.

\---

Okay now for the second (and much shorter) part of this post. Look at all the banners since Dehya:

* Cyno and Dehya
* Ayaka and Shenhe
* Nilou and Nahida
* Baizhu and Ganyu

Most of those pairs make sense. Cyno was due for a rerun, Shenhe supports Ayaka, and Nilou and Nahida work great together. But why is Baizhu with Ganyu?

https://reddit.com/link/1392kfh/video/3szojsrl13ya1/player

I think it's because 3.5 and 3.6 have secretly been a Ganyu expansion pack. Dehya, Nahida, and Ganyu are the core of a Melt Ganyu team, while Shenhe and Baizhu are flex options you pick from based on how confident you are in your dodging.

Now to be clear, I bet if you looked at the numbers the classic Melt Ganyu setups with Kazuha, Xiangling, or Bennett will do more damage than this new team. But here's what this team brings to the table:

* Easier to build. Ganyu doesn't need an EM sands to hit 200 with Nahida (and optionally Dendro resonance), and ~~even her CR isn't as much of an issue because Cryo exists on the enemy long enough for Blizzard Strayer's 4-piece effect to trigger~~ (edit: CR is still a problem because if Blizzard Strayer triggers, you're not Melting. You probably want Gilded Dreams or Wanderer's Troupe). Meanwhile Dehya, Nahida, and Baizhu *basically* don't care about substats or even 4-piece effects in this team so you can focus on getting the right main stats.
* You can leave Dehya, Nahida, and Baizhu's skills at 1 and this team's damage will barely be affected.
* You don't need to be at point blank range. You don't even need to be in Dehya's circle, though if you're running Baizhu the double layers of defense can help.
* General synergy: Dehya's damage redirection makes Baizhu's shield last a bit longer. Baizhu's shield fills in for Dehya's lacking interruption resistance, his heals fix up any scratch damage you get, and his passive makes Burning do a bit more damage when it triggers. Nahida keeps Baizhu charged up and also makes Burning do more damage at C2. You can put whoever you want as the last slot, but Ganyu staying away from the enemy makes Baizhu's weak shield less of an issue.
* ~~Full use of Ganyu's kit. Her burst doesn't hit fast enough to extinguish Burning, and helps ensure Dehya's skill goes off as soon as it can.~~ (edit: Her burst won't extinguish Burning, but her burst + charge shot can. If you want to consistently Melt both parts of her charge shot, it's safer to not burst.) And her skill is useful for keeping enemies in Dehya's circle + refilling her energy so you can burst off cooldown. This could be a con if you don't want to level everything, but I think it's nice when you can use all of a character.

My understanding is that Melt Ganyu's main flaw up until now was how technically demanding and resource intensive it was for the payoff you got. This new team probably doesn't hit the same highs, but it seems a lot easier to use so maybe the playstyle will be more appealing now? At the very least it gives people who got spooked by Dehya something to do with her.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da8mNbrJqbU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da8mNbrJqbU)

In a 11 minute interview (from 5 years ago) with long term UFO researcher Linda Moulton Howe, Tom Delonge paraphrases what the insiders at the Pentagon told him about on the UFO phenomenon.

Here are the biggest takeaways

\-Already stated here many times that the US military/Pentagon calls them not aliens or UFOs but ""The Others""

\-The Pentagon believes that these Others have been Earth on for a very long time, possibly might even be native to the planet

\-Their main base of operations are in Earth's oceans, the moon and deep underground in the Earth

\-Human mythology about gods in ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, Mesoamerica and etc wasn't really mythology

\-These ""gods"" were real and were the workings of ""the others"" with supremely advanced tech that it looked like magic to normal humans

\-These entities are warring with each other and as a consequence humanity is caught in the middle and that also these Others have factionalized humanity using religion as the primary weapon

\-Ton Delonge got into big trouble with his advisers in the Pentagon when he brought up the notion of alien human hybrids (Dr. David M Jacobs anyone?) and the UFO phenomenon obsessive interest in the human soul and human DNA

\-Tom Delonge was told that there are good ""gods"" and bad ""gods""

\-He was also told there are humans working with the bad ""gods"" to fix their DNA and help them proliferate on our planet. He hints it might be Russia and China and in the past Nazi Germany.

\-He was told the US is working with the good ""gods""

\-His advisors believe that the human ""soul"" is the central focus of that these entities and they might be harvesting or farming humanity for some unknown energy that modem science hasn't yet discovered

\-Some of these entities might not have souls (demons from the bible?)

\-Tom Delonge hints that the US invasion of Iraq wasn't about oil or WMDs but about the Others

\-World leaders might be UFO abductees and might be under the influence of The Others so they could start wars (Putins invasion of Ukraine?)

\-Some of these Others are trying to instigate a global nuclear exchange between world powers, Russia and USA being the main actors

\-WW2 wasn't really a war between humans but a war between The Others in which humanity was used like pawns on a chessboard

\-Finally Tom DeLonge was told by his advisors in the Pentagon that the vasty majority of people do not have the skill set to handle these facts and if the truth ever came out it will lead to complete collapse of social order",Comprehensive-Pea304,199,https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/135zv1w/tom_delonge_was_told_by_his_advisers_in_the/,oceans,0.4771460294723511

4049,2023-04-17 20:36:48-05:00,Coachella,Frank Ocean's Performance from a diehard fan's POV,"Ever since [The OF Tape Vol. 2](https://www.google.com/search?q=Odd+Future+The+OF+Tape+Vol.+2&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgFuLSz9U3SMnJzTU1UgKzs4wzjEpStMSzk630c0uLM5P1E4tKMotLrBJzkkpzixexyvqnpCi4lZaUFqUqhGSkKvi7KYQkFqQqhOXn6CkYAQDE-dy-UwAAAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjf7e7pmLL-AhWvJkQIHZ7GDhsQ9OUBegQIJRAD) release in 2012, I've been a diehard fan of Frank Ocean. I've always wanted to see him live but never had the funds until 2019 when I attended Flog Gnaw in hopes of Frank Being the ""???"" headliner (which turned out to be Drake instead (lol)). After that, in 2020, when Frank was initially lined up as a headliner, I bought tickets for Coachella, which would've been my first Coachella attendance. Then Covid hit us, Coachella 2020 was canceled, and Frank was taken off the lineup for 2022, so I sold my ticket to a friend who really wanted to see The Weekend, and I stayed home.

Finally, I bought the pre-register tickets for Coachella 2023 because Frank was rumored to actually headline. When the lineup was announced, I got chills of excitement because I actually got to see the man I idolized and listened to for years.

After watching a bunch of incredible sets on Friday and Saturday (somehow managing to get barricade for Blackpink, which was a performance I'll forever remember and has converted me to a fan), the day had finally come for Frank. I woke up absurdly early and showed up at the Coachella grounds around 11 AM. I ran to the circle stage barricade at the main stage, knowing that it was a gamble but hoping he'd perform a song or two on that circle as he had done in past performances. From 12:30 AM-11:00 PM, I camped out in the sweltering heat, hoping I could have a stellar experience (I made a few friends at the barricades, so shout out to them for making the time go by a lot quicker.) Since I had stayed there the entire day, missing Alex G, which was a shame, I had pretty much put all my eggs into one basket, the basket being Frank.

About an hour after Bjrok's set (which was incredible, especially the light show she had put on), I lost hope with the circle stage, seeing that nothing had moved all day and sandbags were still piled over the tarps covering the stage. I didn't get too upset because I still had a killer view of the main stage area, and I was regardless going to hear Frank live. I was a nervous wreck until 11, when the show started.

It was a slow and confusing start, with a video of his backup dancers on a loop for about five minutes. Then he started Novacane. His vocals were beautiful, but I could tell he didn't sound as lively as I had seen videos of in the past, and it was a major shame that he didn't even fully say the Coachella line in the song. After Novacane, he moved on to some hits, with Bad Religion being his stand-out performance. I got full-body chills from his Bad Religion performance. Though as he progressed, I could tell that things were off. He was taking huge breaks and making strange performance decisions. Then he began his speech about his Brother, Ryan, who had passed. That speech made me tear up because you could hear in his voice how much he missed his brother and how much it was heavily affecting him, especially after \~2\*\* years. After the speech, he sang White Ferarri and then led into the strangest Jersey Remix of the solo I had ever seen. This was the point where I started to get frustrated. The remix felt like it would never end, and the security guard dancing portion felt like a joke to me. After that weird ass DJ mix that wasn't even done by Frank, he ""performed"" a rock song which I really did not expect, and threw for even more of a loop. Then what really got me in a sour mood was when he stood away from his mic and just danced to the backup vocals. It felt like I have waited years for a watch party, not a concert. Frank stayed away from the mic and just ""danced"" along for like 3 or 4 songs without actually singing anything, and then he abruptly stopped the show. Without thanking us for coming or really even showing any empathy towards his audience, he said something along the lines of ""They're telling me it's past curfew, so I have to end the show, sorry,"" and then just left??? I thought it was a prank or a haha funny, but then the lights went off, and people began to leave. So I began to cry. I felt like I had tried so hard to see him for so long, just for a half-assed performance. He didn't even play Pyramids, my favorite song. No Thinking Bout You, no Ivy, no Forrest Gump. I felt cheated. I also felt like the biggest dummy in the world for staying there all day. I wish I could've just seen an authentic Frank performance.

I did learn my lesson, though. Never ever put your eggs in one basket; just have fun and try to see as many people as you can, even if you are not that big of a fan. If it weren't for that insane BlackPink performance, along with Rosalia, Kaytranada, and TV Girl, I would've wasted my money. But regardless, I'm thankful I had a good weekend and at least got to see Frank with my own two eyes and watch him perform. Even if the performance was lack luster, I accomplished my goal.",Vast_Bat_4144,46,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coachella/comments/12q5fue/frank_oceans_performance_from_a_diehard_fans_pov/,oceans,0.49483394622802734

Every single species appears to be bipedal, or capable of bipedal locomotion for short periods, (with most being quadropeds) with bilateral symmetry, and head at the top with a mouth and sensory organs. They even have features that strongly resemble those of Earth clades to the point that we can easily class them as mammals, avians and reptiles with the same features occurring in the same combinations (birds with wings and feathers, reptiles with thick tails scaley hide, mammals with fur and lactation etc.).

&gt;Abiogenesis is a metaphysical belief system, in the 4.4 billion years since life got going on Earth we have ZERO confirmed examples of new organisms emerging from steaming rock pools.  Biology looks like biotech, functions like it and fits with being exactly that.

I am requesting that you call your state reps and governors and ask that a law be created to encourage biodiversity in areas that have been interrupted by human activity. 

Unless someone can recommend something else, I am asking that for every 5 square feet 7+ plant species must be present and for every 15 square feet an additional 7 more native plants need to be present or planted, including a variety of trees.

I am requesting that we restrict mowing only to areas with high volumes of foot traffic (both publicly and privately‚Äîan entire lawn for aesthetic reasons is not justifiable). 

Request the limitation of mowing to very specific dates of the year, to encourage wildflower growth, to reduce carbon production and fossil fuel consumption, and to help the bees, butterflies and more biodiversity.

Also remind them about the Paris Agreement our dedication to reduce carbon and that mowing more than we need to, produces more carbon and consumes fossil fuel at a much higher rate. 

I also think it‚Äôs good to request that next generational planting be done alongside older growth in interrupted areas at the quarter and half cycle of each tree (way before a tree falls sick or becomes an issue (but not to remove the sick tree until it does indeed become an issue).

Request that for any tree removed, that 10 varied trees be planted in close proximity to one another and that they are planted within the same zip code and/or ecosystem. 

Request that tree varieties vary in rows when planting in strips (not all of the same tree on a block, they should vary and alternate). Three trees, three varieties. 

Request that towns plant more densely (it‚Äôs okay if the branches touch and break)

Request that no raking/removal of leaves be done for a percentage of property to encourage soil production, ground coverage, warmth and habitat for hibernating animals; and to restore water tables. What do we think is fair to nature here? 80% of exposed property not be raked?

Protection of seed producing trees. It often takes trees 20-30 years to mature and they are usually removed because of their mess, and people‚Äôs fear of their car becoming slightly dinged up. These trees should be honored over our vehicles‚Äô appearances and other ‚Äújustifications.‚Äù

Low serum B12 level is common in early PD and related to the neuropathy in PD patients. However, B12 deficiency in PD is likely not attributed to the altered gut metabolism, but related to a reduced dietary intake or digestive disorders.

Our data showed that constipation symptom especially bowel movement frequency was a strong confounder on gut microbiota.

We observed an increase of mucin-degrader (i.e., potential gut barrier disrupter) Akkermansia in RBD and early PD.

There is a possibility that the disruption effect of Akkermansia and other mucin-degraders might be reversed by switching to a high-fiber diet.

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-38248-4

 

Constipation usually precedes the motor symptoms of PD and worsens with disease progression. Similarly, the transit times of the small and large intestines are prolonged in PD.

Stimulation of the vagal nerve in mice after administering lipopolysaccharides (LPS) suppresses the inflammation-induced production of TNF-Œ± and interleukin (IL)-6 by microglia.

Environmental exposure to herbicides and pesticides increases the risk of developing PD.

Supplementation with Bifidobacterium improves Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, presumably by inducing the brain-derived neurotrophic factor.

Since butyrate is involved in the formation of the mucus layer in the intestinal epithelium, the intestinal mucosa may not be sufficiently formed in PD.

Low Bifidobacterium abundance is also observed in Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and supplementation with Bifidobacterium improves Alzheimer‚Äôs disease.

This connection may introduce combination therapy with probiotics and melatonin as a suitable and effective therapeutic option for the management of AD.

How does a resilient, biodiverse ecological system control/protect against diseases, if it does at all? 

Please add to and/or correct my thoughts so far. Thank you!!

* With a healthy food web, there are enough predators to control the populations of their prey, and predators would be likely to pursue diseased individuals because they would be easier to hunt. Fewer diseased individuals = Lower risk of disease outbreak
* With access to diverse and necessary resources, immune systems are stronger. So healthier animals might not get sick, even if exposed.
* With a large diversity of species, if one gets wiped out there are others to fill the niche to maintain ecological balance.",fleasnavidad,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/ecology/comments/11qqwmy/how_is_disease_controlled_in_nature_does/,biodiversity,0.4279114603996277

Hi all,

I have a wildflower meadow in year 2 (Only ever cut once in February of this year).  Comparing Spring year 1 to now I have noticed a loss in biodiversity.  Now Red Campion is dominating but I also have a lot of Ribwort, Lesser Knapweed, Birds Trefoil, Bedstraw, Ox Eye, Butter Cup (Meadow &amp; Creeping), Cutleaf Geranium, Red Clover, Salad Burnet, and Wild Carrot.  This could possibly be due to annual vs. perenial flowers but I am a novice.

Might it be an idea to cut a section now to prevent the above (Mostly Campion) from dominating, and let some of the later growing species take hold?

Many thanks!

It‚Äôs quite tiring as we are on the cusp of delegating a large number of tasks that allows us to free up the time of millions of people to pursue a more fulfilling life.

We should be discussing how the economy and society should be prepared to make a fundamental shift. The labor cost saved by implementing these AI and autonomous programs shouldn‚Äôt go straight into the pockets of Wall Street or, at least not all of them. Instead of purposefully implementing roadblocks, we should be discussing a system that collects 70, 75, 80% of the savings from removing the labor force and distributing these first, to the people who are displaced by AI and autonomy and then, eventually, across society on a whole. We should be embracing getting people out of their little cubicle, spending 40 hours a week crunching monotonous numbers under artificial light and not punish them for AI‚Äôs development but, celebrate and compensate them for pursuing something else out of life.

4999,2023-04-28 08:06:21-05:00,dndnext,A level 7 Wizard can casually collapse an economy now,"One of the new ways Wizards can modify their spells is to add the ritual tag to a spell that takes 10min or more to cast. That might seem pretty innocent at first, just saving some slots on non-combat spells, right?

Well, Fabricate has a casting time of 10 minutes. This means that by making it a ritual (thereby adding 10 extra minutes to casting time), a 7th level wizard can cast Fabricate 24 times during an 8 hour working day. 

Assuming labor is about 50% of item cost, which is consistent with some of the crafting rules in 5e books, that's 18,000gp profit a day if you're making Plate armor, and still 2,400gp daily profit if the DM declares people won't buy anything more expensive than Splint.

Obviously other goods can also be crafted at a speed laborers can't even try to compete with, allowing the wizard to take over any aspect of the production economy that they set their mind (and maybe 1 tool proficiency) to. 

The extra funny part is that the only thing that seems to ""balance"" the Create Spell feature of wizards is how expensive it is, but that doesn't really matter anymore when you can absorb the economy of a nearby city into your pockets. 

This isn't even a level 20 complicated transmutation Wizard build. A simple level 7 Wizard of any subclass can do this. This has a big impact on world building in general as well. So thank you for reading my rant, now I'm off to write a bunch of magic hating labor unions into my homebrew worlds.

Edit:
Just to clarify since the comment section is quickly turning into a discussion on medieval economics:

Obviously local economies will eventually correct themselves, obviously luxury crafting quality will still be valuable, and yes, wizards would need a some tool proficiencies for expensive things (although the fabricate spell itself is pretty forgiving with the examples it gives that don't need a tool proficiency). 

This is more of an observation of how potentially powerful/rich wizards can now be during downtime. Since there's no in-game rules about all the supply/demand issues people are talking about in the comments, DMs will need to brush up on their economics if they want to be able to run a game with a wizard in it. 

I agree it's easy to close this loophole as a DM using economic theory, I just think it's funny that WotC would create a loophole that requires that.",Chomp_42,622,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/131r7pf/a_level_7_wizard_can_casually_collapse_an_economy/,economy,0.49130764603614807

5036,2023-05-17 10:25:48-05:00,ExperiencedDevs,I investigated the Underground Economy of Glassdoor Reviews,"Online company reviews are high stakes.

Top reviews on sites like Glassdoor and Google can get thousands of impressions each month and are major drivers of brand perception.

Employers know this. And when I come across multiple 5 star reviews left with no cons, or a Pulitzer worthy essay from a former intern, I become suspicious.

These reviews start to resemble 30 under 30 lists: so artificially constructed that you begin to question their credibility in the first place.

The scrutiny around company reviews is well documented; some companies file lawsuits worth over a million dollars to reveal anonymous reviewers that complain about their jobs.

Whilst it's the flashy lawsuits that make the headlines, there also exists an underground economy of company reviews operating quietly every single day.

In this underground economy, some companies pay over $150 to freelancers to try and get a negative review removed. If they want ‚Äúbetter‚Äù results, they go to the plethora of Online Reputation Management services (ORMs) in the United States that can charge retainers worth thousands of dollars.

The supply of positive reviews exists too. My research led me to find companies, including a prominent Y-Combinator backed startup, that solicit fake positive reviews from online freelancers to improve their rating.

Many of these mercenary fake reviewers, often based in South East Asia, make a full time living doing this, netting over $2,000 per month.

Some of these run such sophisticated operations that they‚Äôve even created their own pricing tiers (e.g $35 per original review, $20 to post an already created review from an email address), a la SaaS offering.

Others operate on a contingency fee agreement model, where they only get paid if they‚Äôre able to take a negative review down.

The underground economy of company reviews is well and truly alive. And today we‚Äôre going to find out how it operates.

***Note***: For more content like this, [*subscribe*](https://www.careerfair.io/subscribe) *to my newsletter. In a couple of weeks, I'll be releasing my guide to writing a killer resume.*

**Adding reviews**

The barriers to entry for adding fake reviews are much lower than for getting reviews removed, so that‚Äôs where we‚Äôll start.

To write an employer review, all you really need is the ability to create an email address. For most sites, you don‚Äôt need any proof of employment (say like a company specific email address).

I went on a gig marketplace site and posted a pretty vague post related to wanting to find out more on how to improve a company‚Äôs online presence.

Within minutes of posting a gig, my inbox was flooded with proposals:

https://preview.redd.it/tj6462grpe0b1.png?width=3064&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=bcec1b3582385a6d19c998642cac6ded2ce7244a

After a bit of chatting, I narrowed the scope of their services and summarized their rates into the table below:

|Channel|Cost|Timeline|Model|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Freelancer #1|$10 per review|Monthly|Unlimited|
|Freelancer #2|$35 per original review, $20 per already created review|Monthly|Unlimited|
|Freelancer #3|$25 per review|Monthly|Unlimited|
|Freelancer #4|$25 per review|Monthly|10 reviews|
|Freelancer #5|$20 per review|Monthly|Unlimited|
|Online Reputation Management Agency|$300 subscription|Monthly|8 reviews|

Let‚Äôs dive a bit deeper into the services that Freelancer #5 offered.

Freelancer #5 explained to me he had been writing reviews for one particular company for the past 4 months now. Each month he wrote them 10 reviews.

https://preview.redd.it/t2j8ihqfqe0b1.png?width=2684&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=25b1a859ddb5e7fc034af6e3cc864d606fb2bb86

In another message, he tells me he‚Äôs offering the same services to 5 other companies. Doing some quick math:

5 companies x 10 reviews per company x $25 per review = $1,250 per month

Considering the average person in Pakistan earns $150 per month, that‚Äôs not bad change at all.

One of the companies that he‚Äôs offering his services to includes a Y-Combinator backed startup. I won‚Äôt name the company, but here‚Äôs what its average Glassdoor review rating distribution looks like:

https://preview.redd.it/c7bq8nqhqe0b1.png?width=2420&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5f567fe9c3ccb8be67790cab519e904f62027268

5 star reviews account for over 77% of the company‚Äôs total reviews. Obviously, no one is buying fake reviews that make them look bad.

But here‚Äôs the thing: freelancers are getting quite smart when it comes to writing reviews that don‚Äôt look too fishy. They tend to do this by spacing the reviews out (so that they don‚Äôt come in ‚Äúspikes‚Äù ‚Äì more on this later) and they also make sure that they‚Äôre not always leaving the ‚Äúcons‚Äù section blank.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, if you come across this company‚Äôs reviews, it‚Äôd be pretty easy to tell they‚Äôre quite strange. In fact, I can‚Äôt even post some screenshots here because it‚Äôd give the company away immediately.

But it would be challenging to conclude that the above company is buying reviews just by analyzing review volume and distribution without actually reading some of the reviews.

The same company is also buying reviews on Google Reviews.

*Sidenote*: I got curious about how he‚Äôs been writing 50 reviews from 50 different emails per month. Would he actually create 50 different email addresses? And what about the IP address ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt Glassdoor flag multiple reviews from the same IP?

One of the freelancers answered my question:

https://preview.redd.it/tu98uzkjqe0b1.png?width=2572&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3a0b368fc8c62aade4a328eaf39c214331903846

Moving on ‚Äì another company that seems to buy fake reviews seems to be having some more trouble. Approximately a month after a freelancer linked me to fake reviews he had written for this company, all five reviews that he had linked me to had been removed:

https://preview.redd.it/tf36r8clqe0b1.png?width=3116&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ad07fb720dc8d34b470fad4f6565afc6803bafab

Based on this [Glassdoor webinar](https://youtu.be/3iy0JWOS1gs) from 2018, ‚Äúif it is found that a user has created multiple email accounts to submit reviews, then ALL submissions from that user are deleted‚Äù ‚Äì so likely Glassdoor‚Äôs content moderation team flagged one of the initial reviews and the same freelancer who was writing reviews for that company had all the fake reviews deleted.

So far, it looks like the key to an effective fake review creation strategy lies in:

* Spacing the fake reviews out
* Writing each review from a different IP address (i.e benefit of being part of a team)
* Using language that isn‚Äôt an obvious giveaway

On that third point: the reality is that many of these freelancers‚Äô first language is not English.

As an experiment, I turned to everybody‚Äôs favorite new toy, ChatGPT, and asked it to write me a positive Glassdoor review:

https://preview.redd.it/8on2901nqe0b1.png?width=3164&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1528665b4d649922cf2e14ebc2d810ce89fabc87

And I‚Äôd say that the above answer was better than 95% of the fake reviews I came across.

**Removing reviews**

The process for removing an employer review usually works like this:

1. You identify one or multiple reviews that you want removed
2. You verify whether the review violates the site's Guidelines, or whether there‚Äôs something else about the review(s) that could get it removed.
3. You file an appeal to get it removed.

As an example, Glassdoor‚Äôs Review guidelines can be found [here](https://help.glassdoor.com/s/article/Community-Guidelines?language=en_US#:~:text=See%20More-,Review%C2%A0Guidelines,-Millions%20of%20job). Mainly, they forbid mentioning anyone by name who‚Äôs not an executive and revealing proprietary or confidential information, amongst a host of other things.

Sounds simple enough right? Well, according to one of the freelancers I messaged:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/56rvj8voqe0b1.png?width=2036&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=94607ac8ac93d28413af2a3edfc5496a7aa7774c

After some research, I summarized the different vendors and prices in the table below:

&amp;#x200B;

|Channel|Cost|Timeline|Model|Self reported success rate|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Freelancer #1|$100 per review|3 days|Contingency Agreement Model|100%|
|Freelancer #2|$30 per review|7 days|Contingency Agreement Model|100%|
|Reputation management service #2|$450 per review|21 business days|Contingency Agreement Model|Unknown|
|Reputation management service #3|$1000 per review|Undefined|Contingency Agreement Model|100%|
|Reputation management service #4 Plan 1|$550 per review|5-6 Weeks|Contingency Agreement Model|50-75%|
|Reputation management service #4 Plan 2|$300 Subscription + $100 per each review removed|Monthly service|Subscription plan|50-75%|
|Freelancer #3|$20 per review|Undefined|Pay regardless|Undefined|
|Freelancer #4|$500 per review|Undefined|Contingency Agreement Model|Undefined|

As you can see, unlike the fake review generation market, the prices vary quite a bit for getting reviews removed.

At one end, you have freelancers on gig marketplaces that will attempt to remove a review for less than $100. And then on the other end, you have ORMs (Online Reputation Management Agencies) that have multiple employees and more comprehensive packages in place. The one constant seems to be that most companies operate on a contingency agreement model (i.e pay only if review gets removed).

**Analyzing reviews**

ReviewMeta is a site that analyzes Amazon reviews and tells you how many are legitimate. The creator of the site, Tommy Noonan, mentions in an [interview with NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2018/06/27/623990036/episode-850-the-fake-review-hunter) that the main giveaway that a product is soliciting fake reviews is:

* A large, suspicious flood of positive reviews at the exact same time. For example, a 3 day stretch of time constituting 30% of total reviews.
* Phrases and words that are constantly repeated, especially in the section with no cons
* Brand monogamists (only review products from one company)

Whilst the last two bullets are hard to track, the first can be used to analyze different companies‚Äô reviews and to check if there might be some funky business going on.

After a couple of days, I have the ability to track review volume and review ratings over time for any company that I specify:

https://preview.redd.it/eknwjoxese0b1.png?width=1653&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=58bf773c3658b3d4d8bb05007917ada99467cf77

Let the games begin.

**Voluntary Response Bias**

One of the biggest challenges that review platforms face is the Voluntary Response bias.

Research shows many of today‚Äôs most popular online review platforms (e.g Amazon) have a distribution of opinion that is highly polarized, with many extreme positive and/or negative reviews, and few moderate opinions.

Think about it: have you ever felt moderately satisfied at your job and thought to yourself, now would be a great time to leave a Glassdoor review? Probably not.

On the other hand, if you‚Äôve had a terrible experience or even just had one thing really flip you off, you might be quite likely to leave an angry review.

Consider when a company goes through layoffs. You‚Äôre going to have a flood of angry reviews coming your way and are likely going to experience a ‚Äúspike‚Äù in reviews.

**Note:** Just like the Wall Street Journal‚Äôs methodology described [here](https://archive.is/20201016094732/https://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-manipulate-glassdoor-by-inflating-rankings-and-pressuring-employees-11548171977#selection-3965.0-3968.0), I considered there to be a spike if the total number of reviews in the month was greater than three standard deviations above the mean of the surrounding months.

Let‚Äôs take the company below. Here‚Äôs a graph of of their review volume since Jan 2020, including when they announced one of their first round of layoffs in June 2022:

https://preview.redd.it/uqbfm3ugse0b1.png?width=3216&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=df4cfda57ee59ac9eedc34e42037338d5024df60

In June 2022, approximately 19% of this company's 52 reviews were 1 star reviews (compared to an overall average of around 10%). This is what we could call a statistically significant spike in reviews. It also illustrates how the employees most likely to leave reviews are the ones that obviously had a bad experience (i.e getting laid off).

Here‚Äôs another company that had a similar spike in negative reviews due to layoffs in November 2022:

https://preview.redd.it/6oo2ipfise0b1.png?width=2408&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7557236f131f88e6b832ff10884253d894cd097c

This company had an approximate 20% 1 star review rate (compared to an overall average of 12%) in November 2022, as well as an Avg Rating of 2.96 that month (compared to an overall average rating of 3.73).Unless HR is proactive, their reviews page risks succumbing to an echochamber of negative reviews that can really tilt one way.

**Note:** Glassdoor does state (based on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iy0JWOS1gs) from 2017) that about 75% of the reviews on their platform are neutral. Their ‚Äúgive to get policy‚Äù has helped in keeping the platform from becoming too polarized.

I can understand why HR teams, like the ones that Nader talked to me about earlier, take a proactive stance towards managing their reviews. If they don‚Äôt try to control their reputation themselves, then their reputation risks getting controlled by the employees that had the worst possible experience.

**Goodhart‚Äôs Law**

Goodhart‚Äôs law states the following:

*""When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure""*

Every October, Glassdoor publishes their Best Places To Work ranking.

In a [report](https://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-manipulate-glassdoor-by-inflating-rankings-and-pressuring-employees-11548171977) that the WSJ did a couple of years ago, they found large spikes in the number of reviews that some companies (e.g SpaceX, Bain &amp; Co, etc) got in September. The logic here is that some companies try to artificially inflate their Glassdoor reviews right before the October deadline.

I decided to revisit some of this analysis with Glassdoor‚Äôs 2023 Best Places To Work Ranking.

One of the companies I examined is rated as one of the best places to work in 2023. Let‚Äôs refer to this company as FunPlaceToWork.

Here is how their review volume looks like for all of 2022:

https://preview.redd.it/a9bktnhlse0b1.png?width=2516&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1963909959a4fc254df1898eabcecef0f1d0e0ee

FunPlaceToWork got around 50 reviews in September 2022. Of those 50 reviews, 96% were 5 star reviews.

FunPlaceToWork averaged 12 reviews per month up till then in 2022. Also, in the prior six months, the average percent of 5 star reviews received every month was \~75%.

Both the spike in volume of reviews and the spike in percentage of five star reviews are statistically significant.

I find it strange that Glassdoor‚Äôs proprietary algorithm and/or Human Content Moderation team did not find a spike of this nature unusual. If we look at Glassdoor‚Äôs eligibility criteria for the award, it‚Äôs as follows:

https://preview.redd.it/4j779c0nse0b1.png?width=2868&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=28c5d3f56e9e449c0c0046f42cd927f6e8452073

The goal, according to Glassdoor, is to collect ‚Äúauthentic and unbiased reviews‚Äù.

Whilst there‚Äôs nothing against the rules for asking your employees to leave you reviews, I find the statistically significant spike of reviews at odds with the goal of collecting ""unbiased and authentic"" reviews (which Glassdoor states is the purpose of the awards).

Glassdoor states that an employer is allowed to ask its employees to leave reviews, but that they are not allowed to ‚Äúcoerce‚Äù them. Examples of what you can‚Äôt do:

* Offer incentives like Gift Cards in exchange for positive reviews.
* Withholding their reference letter unless they leave you a positive review.
* Anything that leads you to require proof for the employee to show you that they wrote a review.

It is possible to play by the rules (i.e not break any of the above rules) and to still in my opinion not collect authentic and unbiased reviews.

They say that you shouldn‚Äôt hate the player but the game ‚Äì I think **FunPlaceToWork** played by the rules, won fair and square, and that this is simply a perfect example of Goodhart‚Äôs Law.

I reached out to Glassdoor ([awards@glassdoor.com](mailto:awards@glassdoor.com)) about the above and this is the reply I got:

https://preview.redd.it/5019eexose0b1.png?width=4800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3d57bbffa933f11cb78e59fa4a33964731d98247

**Conclusion**

When I was 22, on an [F1 visa with 3 months to find work](https://www.careerfair.io/job-hunt-story), I didn‚Äôt give a damn about bad reviews. I needed a job and I‚Äôd sign any piece of paper you put in front of me.

Compare that to someone at the peak of their career, someone with optionality and a multitude of job offers; an ‚ÄúA-Player‚Äù, as the experts call it, would absolutely have the luxury of choice and discard a job offer based on bad company reviews.

For most people, the impact of online company reviews lies somewhere in the middle. In marketing, there‚Äôs a concept of a ‚Äúmarketing touchpoint‚Äù - an interaction with the brand over the course of the whole buying journey.

Company reviews are one of the many touchpoints a job seeker experiences over their interview process. And with the technology industry booming the past couple of years, companies couldn‚Äôt afford to slack on any touchpoints, including this one.

After all, when others start to game the system, you‚Äôre at a disadvantage if you don‚Äôt. The rewards can be quite high. Certainly higher than just trying to be as transparent as possible.

HR leaders are often more incentivized to inflate their metrics than to get honest feedback. Fake review writers have bills to pay. ORMs know that companies are desperate. And the platforms, well, aren‚Äôt always paying attention.

The result is a potluck of interests that leads to an underground economy.

One that ends up hurting the job seeker.

The problem is that once a war starts you need a lot of mobilized forces (especially if you draft), and those forces need arms, ammunition, war machines, and every resource for producing them. If those industries aren't profitable (and you can't directly subsidize then), then when you start mobilizing your entire economy will get fucked as they eat up all the iron, oil etc. This can cascade into complete economic collapse if you're not careful.  
  
In order to prevent this, you need to indirectly subsidize those industries by paying for mobilized soldiers, who will then pay the arms industries for their goods, making them profitable. A good way to do this is join small wars against impoverished nations overseas that present no threat (and MAKE SURE you're not fighting a great power directly). As long as your infamy level stays low enough you don't lose trade, you're golden. You can even just stay in a 'forever' war without any major battles to maintain mobilization.  
  
Anyways, enough about Iraq. I'm so hyped for the update I can't finish any games. Who are you guys going to play first?

From streamlining more materials (getting rid of planetary mats was a good change) to lower costs for focusing, Destiny on the surface feels a little more approachable. However, with cores and shards becoming much more integral to the game's experience, there is an underlying issue brewing - I don't think we're getting enough materials as we should be.

Focusing has been a great boon to Destiny, but with shards still being very costly to get what you want, it can feel like you get drained out of shards pretty easily. Cores now being a part of crafting so that you can change your perks can also be very costly if you want to experiment. 

I think it's great that more activities just give you shards and cores for completing, but only getting maybe 4 at a time per strike or crucible match can leave me feel like my time isn't being respected. The feeling is even more intense after completing legendary lost sectors solo. I can get out of a master lost sector with only earning maybe 1-2 cores sometimes, and it feels like I put in all of this work/effort for not a lot back. Not to mention you have a chance to not even get an exotic from it. This makes me feel like Bungie is being rather cautious to give players too much loot, but I digress.

I would love to have a blogpost from the Economy team about the current state of D2's economy. The eagerness of players jumping to a legendary shard exploit to farm currency should state something. Does the economy team feel like players are getting enough? If not, are there any plans in the future to change this?",ZokInsaneMathWizard,291,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/12ud3uf/would_love_a_blogpost_from_the_economy_team_on/,economy,0.4835512042045593

5092,2023-05-15 16:45:36-05:00,datascience,I investigated the Underground Economy of Glassdoor Reviews,"Online company reviews are high stakes.

Top reviews on sites like Glassdoor and Google can get thousands of impressions each month and are major drivers of brand perception.

Employers know this. And when I come across multiple 5 star reviews left with no cons, or a Pulitzer worthy essay from a former intern, I become suspicious.

These reviews start to resemble 30 under 30 lists: so artificially constructed that you begin to question their credibility in the first place.

The scrutiny around company reviews is well documented; some companies file lawsuits worth over a million dollars to reveal anonymous reviewers that complain about their jobs.

Whilst it's the flashy lawsuits that make the headlines, there also exists an underground economy of company reviews operating quietly every single day.

In this underground economy, some companies pay over $150 to freelancers to try and get a negative review removed. If they want ‚Äúbetter‚Äù results, they go to the plethora of Online Reputation Management services (ORMs) in the United States that can charge retainers worth thousands of dollars.

The supply of positive reviews exists too. My research led me to find companies, including a prominent Y-Combinator backed startup, that solicit fake positive reviews from online freelancers to improve their rating.

Many of these mercenary fake reviewers, often based in South East Asia, make a full time living doing this, netting over $2,000 per month.

Some of these run such sophisticated operations that they‚Äôve even created their own pricing tiers (e.g $35 per original review, $20 to post an already created review from an email address), a la SaaS offering.

Others operate on a contingency fee agreement model, where they only get paid if they‚Äôre able to take a negative review down.

The underground economy of company reviews is well and truly alive. And today we‚Äôre going to find out how it operates.

**Adding reviews**

The barriers to entry for adding fake reviews are much lower than for getting reviews removed, so that‚Äôs where we‚Äôll start.

To write an employer review, all you really need is the ability to create an email address. For most sites, you don‚Äôt need any proof of employment (say like a company specific email address).

I went on a gig marketplace site and posted a pretty vague post related to wanting to find out more on how to improve a company‚Äôs online presence.

Within minutes of posting a gig, my inbox was flooded with proposals:

https://preview.redd.it/esx3904qa20b1.png?width=3064&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7579e9121fae3788cafa3b3860b88b2526b4807a

After a bit of chatting, I narrowed the scope of their services and summarized their rates into the table below:

|Channel|Cost|Timeline|Model|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Freelancer #1|$10 per review|Monthly|Unlimited|
|Freelancer #2|$35 per original review, $20 per already created review|Monthly|Unlimited|
|Freelancer #3|$25 per review|Monthly|Unlimited|
|Freelancer #4|$25 per review|Monthly|10 reviews|
|Freelancer #5|$20 per review|Monthly|Unlimited|
|Online Reputation Management Agency|$300 subscription|Monthly|8 reviews|

Let‚Äôs dive a bit deeper into the services that Freelancer #5 offered.

Freelancer #5 explained to me he had been writing reviews for one particular company for the past 4 months now. Each month he wrote them 10 reviews.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n1ddox6cb20b1.png?width=2684&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2ef0b51da38b78eefd1eff693484ee4d770f3ae6

In another message, he tells me he‚Äôs offering the same services to 5 other companies. Doing some quick math:

5 companies x 10 reviews per company x $25 per review = $1,250 per month

Considering the average person in Pakistan earns $150 per month, that‚Äôs not bad change at all.

One of the companies that he‚Äôs offering his services to includes a Y-Combinator backed startup. I won‚Äôt name the company, but here‚Äôs what its average Glassdoor review rating distribution looks like:

https://preview.redd.it/2np5b6fdb20b1.png?width=2420&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=81b9cc35226baf4ff8be0b199358958632fcdc5b

5 star reviews account for over 77% of the company‚Äôs total reviews. Obviously, no one is buying fake reviews that make them look bad.

But here‚Äôs the thing: freelancers are getting quite smart when it comes to writing reviews that don‚Äôt look too fishy. They tend to do this by spacing the reviews out (so that they don‚Äôt come in ‚Äúspikes‚Äù ‚Äì more on this later) and they also make sure that they‚Äôre not always leaving the ‚Äúcons‚Äù section blank.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, if you come across this company‚Äôs reviews, it‚Äôd be pretty easy to tell they‚Äôre quite strange. In fact, I can‚Äôt even post some screenshots here because it‚Äôd give the company away immediately.

But it would be challenging to conclude that the above company is buying reviews just by analyzing review volume and distribution without actually reading some of the reviews.

The same company is also buying reviews on Google Reviews.

Sidenote: I got curious about how he‚Äôs been writing 50 reviews from 50 different emails per month. Would he actually create 50 different email addresses? And what about the IP address ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt Glassdoor flag multiple reviews from the same IP?

One of the freelancers answered my question:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g4id2yqeb20b1.png?width=2572&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6259b9383e789d3842a682905fc8ada1e3debfaa

Moving on ‚Äì another company that seems to buy fake reviews seems to be having some more trouble. Approximately a month after a freelancer linked me to fake reviews he had written for this company, all five reviews that he had linked me to had been removed:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/99fdvcgfb20b1.png?width=3116&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fd2e8ea258c1f8c448ce69eb55740ea0ae4ecd1a

Based on this [Glassdoor webinar](https://youtu.be/3iy0JWOS1gs) from 2018, ‚Äúif it is found that a user has created multiple email accounts to submit reviews, then ALL submissions from that user are deleted‚Äù ‚Äì so likely Glassdoor‚Äôs content moderation team flagged one of the initial reviews and the same freelancer who was writing reviews for that company had all the fake reviews deleted.

So far, it looks like the key to an effective fake review creation strategy lies in:

* Spacing the fake reviews out
* Writing each review from a different IP address (i.e benefit of being part of a team)
* Using language that isn‚Äôt an obvious giveaway

On that third point: the reality is that many of these freelancers‚Äô first language is not English.

As an experiment, I turned to everybody‚Äôs favorite new toy, ChatGPT, and asked it to write me a positive Glassdoor review:

https://preview.redd.it/8w7cal9gb20b1.png?width=3164&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=40c0fee4b16081f3566ff463d629dbb8e98c9e8b

And I‚Äôd say that the above answer was better than 95% of the fake reviews I came across.

**Removing reviews**

The process for removing an employer review usually works like this:

1. You identify one or multiple reviews that you want removed
2. You verify whether the review violates the site's Guidelines, or whether there‚Äôs something else about the review(s) that could get it removed.
3. You file an appeal to get it removed.

As an example, Glassdoor‚Äôs Review guidelines can be found [here](https://help.glassdoor.com/s/article/Community-Guidelines?language=en_US#:~:text=See%20More-,Review%C2%A0Guidelines,-Millions%20of%20job). Mainly, they forbid mentioning anyone by name who‚Äôs not an executive and revealing proprietary or confidential information, amongst a host of other things.

Sounds simple enough right? Well, according to one of the freelancers I messaged:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x6s8hsyac20b1.png?width=2036&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c4909cd57ee5052a8e29c6752b0345f3f9ccc499

After some research, I summarized the different vendors and prices in the table below:

&amp;#x200B;

|Channel|Cost|Timeline|Model|Self reported success rate|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Freelancer #1|$100 per review|3 days|Contingency Agreement Model|100%|
|Freelancer #2|$30 per review|7 days|Contingency Agreement Model|100%|
|Reputation management service #2|$450 per review|21 business days|Contingency Agreement Model|Unknown|
|Reputation management service #3|$1000 per review|Undefined|Contingency Agreement Model|100%|
|Reputation management service #4 Plan 1|$550 per review|5-6 weeks|Contingency Agreement Model|50-75%|
|Reputation management service #4 Plan 2|$300 Subscription + $100 per each review removed|Monthly service|Subscription plan|50-75%|
|Freelancer #3|$20|Undefined|Pay regardless|Undefined|
|Freelancer #4|$500|Undefined|Contingency Agreement Model|Undefined|

As you can see, unlike the fake review generation market, the prices vary quite a bit for getting reviews removed.

At one end, you have freelancers on gig marketplaces that will attempt to remove a review for less than $100. And then on the other end, you have ORMs (Online Reputation Management Agencies) that have multiple employees and more comprehensive packages in place. The one constant seems to be that most companies operate on a contingency agreement model (i.e pay only if review gets removed).

**Analyzing reviews**

ReviewMeta is a site that analyzes Amazon reviews and tells you how many are legitimate. The creator of the site, Tommy Noonan, mentions in an [interview with NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2018/06/27/623990036/episode-850-the-fake-review-hunter) that the main giveaway that a product is soliciting fake reviews is:

* A large, suspicious flood of positive reviews at the exact same time. For example, a 3 day stretch of time constituting 30% of total reviews.
* Phrases and words that are constantly repeated, especially in the section with no cons
* Brand monogamists (only review products from one company)

Whilst the last two bullets are hard to track, the first can be used to analyze different companies‚Äô reviews and to check if there might be some funky business going on.

After a couple of days, I have the ability to track review volume and review ratings over time for any company that I specify:

https://preview.redd.it/ehcbw2oje20b1.png?width=1653&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=623cf53c614997f421fd9c739ef369c57a25156e

Let the games begin.

## Voluntary Response Bias

One of the biggest challenges that review platforms face is the Voluntary Response bias.

Research shows many of today‚Äôs most popular online review platforms (e.g Amazon) have a distribution of opinion that is highly polarized, with many extreme positive and/or negative reviews, and few moderate opinions.

Think about it: have you ever felt moderately satisfied at your job and thought to yourself, now would be a great time to leave a Glassdoor review? Probably not.

On the other hand, if you‚Äôve had a terrible experience or even just had one thing really flip you off, you might be quite likely to leave an angry review.

Consider when a company goes through layoffs. You‚Äôre going to have a flood of angry reviews coming your way and are likely going to experience a ‚Äúspike‚Äù in reviews.

**Note:** Just like the Wall Street Journal‚Äôs methodology described [here](https://archive.is/20201016094732/https://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-manipulate-glassdoor-by-inflating-rankings-and-pressuring-employees-11548171977#selection-3965.0-3968.0), I considered there to be a spike if the total number of reviews in the month was greater than three standard deviations above the mean of the surrounding months.

Let‚Äôs take the company below. Here‚Äôs a graph of of their review volume since Jan 2020, including when they announced one of their first round of layoffs in June 2022:

https://preview.redd.it/n6kd9ejle20b1.png?width=3216&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4c43d3f61ba0ab20a1b6de37548dc073d0b15e33

In June 2022, approximately 19% of this company's 52 reviews were 1 star reviews (compared to an overall average of around 10%). This is what we could call a statistically significant spike in reviews. It also illustrates how the employees most likely to leave reviews are the ones that obviously had a bad experience (i.e getting laid off).

Here‚Äôs another company that had a similar spike in negative reviews due to layoffs in November 2022:

https://preview.redd.it/4vcnr1ine20b1.png?width=2408&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a7f8c0c888855c27dd688e511545b9bad134a374

This company had an approximate 20% 1 star review rate (compared to an overall average of 12%) in November 2022, as well as an Avg Rating of 2.96 that month (compared to an overall average rating of 3.73).Unless HR is proactive, their reviews page risks succumbing to an echochamber of negative reviews that can really tilt one way.

**Note:** Glassdoor does state (based on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iy0JWOS1gs) from 2017) that about 75% of the reviews on their platform are neutral. Their ‚Äúgive to get policy‚Äù has helped in keeping the platform from becoming too polarized.

I can understand why HR teams, like the ones that Nader talked to me about earlier, take a proactive stance towards managing their reviews. If they don‚Äôt try to control their reputation themselves, then their reputation risks getting controlled by the employees that had the worst possible experience.

## Goodhart‚Äôs Law

Goodhart‚Äôs law states the following:

*""When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure""*

Every October, Glassdoor publishes their Best Places To Work ranking.

In a [report](https://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-manipulate-glassdoor-by-inflating-rankings-and-pressuring-employees-11548171977) that the WSJ did a couple of years ago, they found large spikes in the number of reviews that some companies (e.g SpaceX, Bain &amp; Co, etc) got in September. The logic here is that some companies try to artificially inflate their Glassdoor reviews right before the October deadline.

I decided to revisit some of this analysis with Glassdoor‚Äôs 2023 Best Places To Work Ranking.

One of the companies I examined is rated as one of the best places to work in 2023. Let‚Äôs refer to this company as FunPlaceToWork.

Here is how their review volume looks like for all of 2022:

https://preview.redd.it/4e656zkqe20b1.png?width=2516&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6576dde7f8f303cbd39b4acc57dccae3a369dafc

FunPlaceToWork got around 50 reviews in September 2022. Of those 50 reviews, 96% were 5 star reviews.

FunPlaceToWork averaged 12 reviews per month up till then in 2022. Also, in the prior six months, the average percent of 5 star reviews received every month was \~75%.

Both the spike in volume of reviews and the spike in percentage of five star reviews are statistically significant.

I find it strange that Glassdoor‚Äôs proprietary algorithm and/or Human Content Moderation team did not find a spike of this nature unusual. If we look at Glassdoor‚Äôs eligibility criteria for the award, it‚Äôs as follows:

https://preview.redd.it/hag04y7se20b1.png?width=2868&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=64cfab5b92e4ec465445a41bf3e837112ce0fcf1

The goal, according to Glassdoor, is to collect ‚Äúauthentic and unbiased reviews‚Äù.

Whilst there‚Äôs nothing against the rules for asking your employees to leave you reviews, I find the statistically significant spike of reviews at odds with the goal of collecting ""unbiased and authentic"" reviews (which Glassdoor states is the purpose of the awards).

Glassdoor states that an employer is allowed to ask its employees to leave reviews, but that they are not allowed to ‚Äúcoerce‚Äù them. Examples of what you can‚Äôt do:

* Offer incentives like Gift Cards in exchange for positive reviews.
* Withholding their reference letter unless they leave you a positive review.
* Anything that leads you to require proof for the employee to show you that they wrote a review.

It is possible to play by the rules (i.e not break any of the above rules) and to still in my opinion not collect authentic and unbiased reviews.

They say that you shouldn‚Äôt hate the player but the game ‚Äì I think **FunPlaceToWork** played by the rules, won fair and square, and that this is simply a perfect example of Goodhart‚Äôs Law.

I reached out to Glassdoor ([awards@glassdoor.com](mailto:awards@glassdoor.com)) about the above and this is the reply I got:

https://preview.redd.it/x0dqq39ue20b1.png?width=4800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=13ddb76e1cc150b4b272acccda7ac1dec78f06a5

**Conclusion**

When I was 22, on an [F1 visa with 3 months to find work](https://www.careerfair.io/job-hunt-story), I didn‚Äôt give a damn about bad reviews. I needed a job and I‚Äôd sign any piece of paper you put in front of me.

Compare that to someone at the peak of their career, someone with optionality and a multitude of job offers; an ‚ÄúA-Player‚Äù, as the experts call it, would absolutely have the luxury of choice and discard a job offer based on bad company reviews.

For most people, the impact of online company reviews lies somewhere in the middle. In marketing, there‚Äôs a concept of a ‚Äúmarketing touchpoint‚Äù - an interaction with the brand over the course of the whole buying journey.

Company reviews are one of the many touchpoints a job seeker experiences over their interview process. And with the technology industry booming the past couple of years, companies couldn‚Äôt afford to slack on any touchpoints, including this one.

After all, when others start to game the system, you‚Äôre at a disadvantage if you don‚Äôt. The rewards can be quite high. Certainly higher than just trying to be as transparent as possible.

HR leaders are often more incentivized to inflate their metrics than to get honest feedback. Fake review writers have bills to pay. ORMs know that companies are desperate. And the platforms, well, aren‚Äôt always paying attention.

The result is a potluck of interests that leads to an underground economy.

One that ends up hurting the job seeker.

I have requested partial refunds periodically for missing and incorrect items (usually from incorrect items on gas station snack orders; the gas station employees where I live usually send a random food item if something isn‚Äôt in stock.)

Today, one of my items was missing in a fast food order, and I requested a refund for that item. I spoke with a Chat Agent, who seemed harsh and angry (which has never happened to me on previous support chats) and they informed me that my account has reached the maximum number of refunds. Maybe because I have gotten a couple dozen refunds over the years, but that‚Äôs because I‚Äôve made like 200 orders since being a customer! I‚Äôm assuming the agent thought I was one of those scammers who pretend they didn‚Äôt receive their orders. 

I‚Äôve decided to end my DashPass and will not be ordering anymore. It seems like a bad business practice to completely eliminate the option for me to ever be refunded for something. However, this will probably be a good thing for me, because I frequently order junk food and have been trying to cut back. Goodbye DD!

Edit: I wrote this so quick, I should‚Äôve made it clear I‚Äôve only received **partial** refunds for missing/incorrect items for the last 6 or so years, a handful of times per year.

I‚Äôm u/gregthegeth, a member of our ads product team. Two years ago [we notified everyone](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/mawomr/new_option_to_add_gender_identity_during_account/) of a new initiative allowing redditors to optionally share their gender identity when signing up for a new account. We‚Äôve since used this information to better inform content and community recommendations. We explained that in the future we may use gender identity for other purposes, such as ads, and that [we would update the community](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/mawomr/comment/gs3u7ex/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) if anything changed.

That day has arrived, and today we want to let you know that we will soon begin using self-disclosed gender identity to personalize ads on our platform. The goal of this change is to ensure that the content you see on Reddit - including advertising - is as relevant to you as possible. You can read more about this in our recently updated [Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/policies/privacy-policy).

Importantly, sharing your gender and other personal information of this kind is totally optional on Reddit.

**When is this happening?**

This change will take effect on April 24, 2023. Until then, we want to make sure redditors are aware of this upcoming change and that they have plenty of time to adjust their account settings and remove their gender information if they wish. In addition to this post, we will send private messages to redditors that previously provided their gender to make users aware of this update. Redditors that have not previously provided their gender will be informed of this change during the account creation process and on the account settings page where they provide their gender.

I have read about not \*requiring\* password changes (unless you reasonably think the password(s) have been compromised) but instead require very strong passwords, as apparently changing passwords frequently can make people use predictable patterns on the change and similar but... not allowing password changes \*at all\* does not make sense in my head.

5323,2023-05-21 00:55:43-05:00,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,First weekend of the summer where we‚Äôre not bending on our pool policy and I almost started a riot.,"UPDATE:  check below for the Monday morning update to this Saturday night fiasco

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

So there I am, five minutes after the posted time our pool closes defending myself against 5 very aggressive sports team parents as they shout at me for being asked to leave the pool area per our posted hours.

One woman wants me fired on the spot.

One father is shouting that I‚Äôm an ‚Äúasshole‚Äù and ‚Äúon a power trip‚Äù

One woman is inferring I‚Äôm responsible for the $200 worth of meat she bought to BBQ 5 minutes after our pool/BBQ area closes.

‚ÄúBUT WHAT ABOUT OUR KIDS?!‚Äù one Mom screams.

‚Ä¶the children have already moved over to the lobby and are playing on our free pool table.

Let me back up.  This is a lot to take in without context.

‚Äî‚Äî-

I‚Äôve been at my current big corporate chain hotel for about three months now.  My GM and FOM like my style. The online reviews are in and I test well with our guests.  

So what is my reward for being the hot new rookie?  I GET TO WORK every Thur/Fri/Sat 3-11 shift forever and ever!!

Ok, I‚Äôm lying.  I work those shifts because it‚Äôs the best strategy for our team, and I really like my hotel and my team so I‚Äôm a team player.

In the years past, the front desk team let guests get away with anything.  I‚Äôve personally heard tales of a guest walking up on a Front Desk Agent sleeping (with a blanket and pillow) on a couch in the lobby.  When the guest woke this Agent up, they handed the guest the keys to the laundry room and told the guest they could get their own sheets.  Yeah, that‚Äôs where this hotel was a mere few years ago.

Fast forward to now.  We have a relatively fresh team, and we all are pretty good at our jobs.  Now that the team is in place, it‚Äôs time to start taking back our hotel and restoring a little order.

First order of business:  not letting whoever stroll into our pool and stay as late as they want and do whatever they want (booze, glass, drugs, non-guests showing up, non-guests throwing parties poolside without giving a dime to our hotel).

We started enforcing the policy posted on the wall:  Pool Hours - 10am to 8pm.

This morning, one of our part-part timers that covers a shift maybe once or twice a month had 7-3. The dude wasn‚Äôt hip to our new plan.  Not his fault. It was an oversight.  He told a few check ins the pool closes at 10.

Well, apparently one person with some misinformation means that is the policy set in stone to these guests.  That‚Äôs what started the whole fit‚Ä¶

‚ÄúWell, (morning dude) told us the pool closes at 10‚Äù

Well‚Ä¶sorry Morning Dude was wrong. What does that have to do with what I‚Äôm telling you now?

‚ÄúIt says online that y‚Äôall close the pool at 10‚Äù

Please show me where it says that.  All these hours later I still see none of this damning evidence.

‚ÄúYeeeeckspeedeeyuh has it listed at 10pm.‚Äù

Yeah, they lied to you.  Not me.

It stretched out into a 45 minute ordeal.  So many angry middle class white people ‚Äî- which are the most hilarious group of people when they try to be passive aggressive. (Before you think this is racial, I am Hhwyte myself)

How am I supposed to be terrified or take a threat seriously when a guy in khaki shorts and a visor is saying things like ‚Äúyou sure are gonna be sorry tomorrow, buddy!  I‚Äôm calling (paused for dramatic effect) CORPORATE‚Ä¶.‚Äù?

It reached a conclusion when I took a gamble.  Surrounded by seven angry sports team parents I said ‚Äúlisten.  You all feel strongly about this.  If you‚Äôd like to meet me at my computer, and line up, I will check you all out and remove tonight‚Äôs charge from your reservation.

Huge gamble. If they said yes, I‚Äôd probably be fired.  BUT THEY DIDNT.

‚ÄúWhere are we supposed to go?!‚Äù

Me:  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôd prefer you all just stay here and use the rooms you paid for‚Äù

And there it was. They knew it was a lost cause.

They made sure to speak loudly enough so I‚Äôd hear:  apparently the ‚ÄúProgram of Honor‚Ñ¢Ô∏è‚Äù is issuing all of them refunds.  I hope that happens for them honestly.

This is the first weekend of the summer.  Can‚Äôt wait for 15 more weeks of this!!

UPDATE:  It‚Äôs Monday morning.  A full investigation into what is being said online and outside of our hotel about our pool hours.  WHAT A SURPRISE!  The guest was lying!!  The pool hours are not listed on our website or in any link from the first page of google.

The only thing mentioned on our website is we have a pool and to inquire about its use.  I‚Äôm also hearing that our 7-3 staff did not speak to anyone in particular about pool hours.  General rule of thumb, as a professional courtesy, AM shift does not give definitive answers to PM shift policy and vice versa.  The way it‚Äôs said to guest is ‚ÄúI think it may be XXX, but check with the evening front desk shift for clarification‚Ä¶‚Äù",AfghaniMoon,85,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/13nkgtc/first_weekend_of_the_summer_where_were_not/,policy,0.4952462613582611

Now Liberty Mutual won't rewrite the policy for me based on ""data from my location.""","The new policy Mr. Cooper assigned covers only fire damage, is an inferior product, and costs roughly $800 more per year so my mortgage will be going up.

I'm furious. I'd been in touch with Liberty Mutual with promises of calls back that never came, same with Mr. Cooper. Each company is blaming the other, today (after a month of waiting) I finally got them both on a conference call, mentioned Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, that I'd be filing a complaint and that Mr. Cooper was liable. Now they are both blaming me, saying that ultimately was my responsibility when notices were sent out. It seems Mr. Cooper did everything it was supposed to in requesting a bill from Liberty Mutual and they failed to provide it.

I did my part and called Liberty Mutual to inform them that Mr. Cooper was the holder of my mortgage loan after buying it from Rocket following my refinancing in March of 22. When I received a notice that my home insurance had not yet been paid I assumed it was some pandemic related hiccup, but then the news came that my policy had been cancelled and Mr. Cooper selected a different one. It turns out that Liberty Mutual had been sending payment requests to Rocket, the prior company I had refinanced with-Wouldn't they have told them about the change as well?

The rep from Mr. Cooper advised me to write to Corporate and she was going to attempt to get the new insurance company they selected to provide the same coverage for the same price I was paying prior. Anyone have any suggestions on how to phrase this letter&gt;? Should I be pushing back harder at Liberty Mutual? It seems there's nothing they can do.

Edit to add: A few people are confused, when I say plastic, I mean actual currency not a card.

5350,2023-05-22 03:56:42-05:00,Swingers,Played with swinger couple who wanted full swap but other wife has one-penis policy,"I've been struggling with this for a while. My hubby (m) and I (f) have been getting along great with a couple and have played with them (soft play only) a few times, but now I'm reevaluating whether they are a good fit for our future play sessions. 

The women are bi, the husbands are straight. The other wife doesn't play with other men at all. We were ok with that since I play with women and my husband and I only soft play. 

The last time we played with them at a club, I played with her a lot and husbands watched, then we each played with her husband. I also gave her husband oral and that's when she let my husband know she doesn't play with men (at all-- as in doesn't even touch other penises). We were all okay with it, particularly since she is not really even my husband's type. The dynamic it has created though is that if I do soft play with her husband, she and my husband just watch, and during play sessions I'm pleasing three people. Totally doable for me but after talking with my husband we decided to shift the balance more towards girl-on-girl play and parallel play. 

We did our first ever hotel play session with them a couple weeks ago and what happened had me second guessing a lot. I played with her, my husband and I had intermittent sex, but I really cut down on giving the other husband oral sex. But then, while my husband was out of earshot, the other husband (who had been displaying a lot of interest in me throughout the play session) asked  me if he could penetrate me . I politely declined. I know that he was just in the moment, but it really bothered me that he'd ask for that knowing my husband and I haven't had sex with other people, and knowing his wife won't even touch my husband in a sexual way. I don't envision myself ever doing a full swap in that kind of setting (where my husband wasn't full swapping as well). This is not a critique of others who would be fine with it,  but it seems inherently unfair to me...

Anyway,  I've been struggling through a lot of emotions about the couple since then because I'm not sure I want to play with them again after that. We get along really great in a casual setting,  so there's a part of me that feels disappointed. I feel like I should communicate why I don't want to play as a group anymore but don't know how to articulate the way I feel about the situation without being misunderstood. The wife has every right not to play with other men, but we're looking for a couple with a woman who will engage with my husband. I hate for her to misinterpret that as me trying to pursue her into doing something with my husband. I just think our play sessions need to come to an end. 

And I'm not sure if my indignation about the other husband asking me for sex is justified. Is this ""wife poaching"" or was it normal for him to ask since we'd all played together a few time before and most men would think it's a natural progression?  I just feel confused and disappointed. There's a part of me wondering if I just mismanaged this or got played by a couple I like. The whole thing has left me feeling like I need a break from our swinger community.",Feisty_Pen_4280,108,https://www.reddit.com/r/Swingers/comments/13olb77/played_with_swinger_couple_who_wanted_full_swap/,policy,0.4264691174030304

5423,2023-05-16 09:29:48-05:00,asklatinamerica,"Canada has the ‚Äòworst housing crisis‚Äô in the first world, per CBC. This is now being blamed on their migration policy mostly only allowing people with qualified professional expertise. Do you think its a bad idea to mostly only allow people of professional labor to migrate to your country?","The average Canadian house price rose to $716,000 in April, up by $100K since January, per CBC. This is higher than the US average house price. 

This is a very high percentage increase, and for contrast the American housing is currently stagnating or dropping in average cost (compared to 2022). 

Canada outlawed foreigners without work visas from purchasing property in Canada as of January 1st, 2023. However, this did not fix the issue (at least completely) as you see that prices still went up 100k USD. 

Now people are blaming their migration policy, where mostly only people of qualified expertise are allowed to migrate. The idea is that these people usually make more than the average Canadian. And when they move they need a place to live. Thus, inflating prices.

**Now, about Latin America. This is already sort of happening with ‚Äòdigital nomads‚Äô that move to places like Colombia or Costa Rica.**

Not in the large number of Canada. (Canada let‚Äôs in about half a million migrants per year. With a population of 38 million). 1/4 of Canadian workforce is migrants. 36% of doctors and 31% of engineers are migrant. 

Do you think your country should adopt policies alike those of Canada or Australia where mostly only professionals can migrate. Or do you believe this sort of consequence is likely to happen? 

also, do you believe this is likely to happen regardless due to remote workers from the first world?

I know that this isn't a sports sub, but I feel the need to commend Dwyane Wade and his wife Gabriel Union on the raising of their daughter Zaya (Union is her step-mother), who came out as Trans back in 2020.  People shouldn't underestimate how big of deal this is.  To say that Wade is a Florida legend because of what he accomplished with the Miami Heat would be an understatement.  

And when you also factor in that sports in general has never really been that pro LGBTQIA+ (especially on the men's side of things), Wade has become a rather shinning example of bucking the trend.  So big ups to Wade and Union for doing what's right for their family, and hopefully other individuals of prominence will follow suit.",Amazed_and_Bemused,116,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fauxmoi/comments/13066tu/dwyane_wade_says_he_moved_family_out_of_fl_over/,policy,0.4538062810897827

Hey y'all, editing this post a day later because I want to share an example of how I use chatGPT, and while I understand that this is not a flawless process, and the conversations that I leave with are not concrete until I fully think them out, but a lot of the times they make a lot of sense. Check out the conversation below!



Hi I have a question about humility. I've had a really rough life, I've had times when I've been picked on for my physical traits, I've been bullied a lot, but I've come out the other side and I've grown a lot as a person. I feel like I have a pretty wide perspective on the possible boxes you can be put into in society because of all of my intersectional traits. I find as a result i don't see myself as special, I don't view myself as better than anyone else inherently at anything. That being said though there are times that I get hit on by women because I'm a pretty attractive dude and it makes me feel good, and while I'm feeling good I often snap at myself and say stop being so obsessed over yourself even though I'm pretty sure it's only a temporary. I'm so hard on myself for making sure I stay humble. Do you have any advice for my situation?

It's great that you have a wide perspective on societal boxes and don't view yourself as better than anyone else. It sounds like you have developed a good sense of humility. However, it's also natural to feel good when you receive compliments, and there's nothing wrong with feeling good about yourself.

It's important to remember that humility is not about thinking less of yourself, but rather thinking of yourself less. It's about being able to acknowledge your strengths and accomplishments while also recognizing that they do not define your worth as a person. So, if you receive compliments or recognition for something, it's okay to feel good about it. Just try to balance it out by also acknowledging your flaws and areas where you can improve.

It's also important to practice self-compassion and be kind to yourself. Don't be too hard on yourself for feeling good about yourself. Instead, try to cultivate an attitude of gratitude and appreciation for the good things in your life. Remember that it's okay to enjoy the positive aspects of your life as long as you don't let them define you or make you feel superior to others.

In summary, keep striving for humility, but also allow yourself to feel good about your accomplishments and positive qualities. Practice self-compassion and gratitude, and try to find a balance between acknowledging your strengths and recognizing your flaws.

Holy crap am I just not familiar with feeling good about myself? Is that why I'm so hard on myself for what I perceive as not being humble?

It's possible that your experiences of being picked on and bullied in the past have made it difficult for you to feel good about yourself without feeling like you're being arrogant or boastful. It's important to remember that feeling good about yourself is a natural and healthy part of being human, and it doesn't necessarily mean that you're being arrogant or egotistical.

It's also possible that you have internalized beliefs or messages from your past experiences that make you feel like you don't deserve to feel good about yourself or that it's not okay to acknowledge your strengths or accomplishments. If this is the case, it may be helpful to work with a therapist or counselor to explore and challenge these beliefs and learn new ways of thinking about yourself and your accomplishments.

Remember that humility is not about putting yourself down or denying your strengths or accomplishments, but rather about recognizing that everyone has their own unique strengths and weaknesses, and that no one person is better or more valuable than another. By cultivating a balanced perspective on yourself and others, you can continue to develop your sense of humility while also feeling good about yourself and your positive qualities.

Holy crap! You just blew my mind. You just course corrected so many false ideas that I had for so long. I understand it's all situational and contextual, but as general rules I think that You've helped me realize that I need to give myself room to feel good because in a perfect world everyone would feel good about themselves. It sounds like I was confused about what it meant to be humble. Being humble is thinking of yourself less of the time in general. Would that include talking about yourself less?

Yes, being humble can include talking about yourself less, but it's also important to recognize that there are appropriate times and contexts in which it's okay to talk about yourself and your accomplishments.

For example, if someone asks you about your accomplishments or experiences, it's okay to share that information with them. The key is to do so in a way that is respectful and appropriate, without boasting or putting others down.

It's also important to remember that being humble is not about diminishing yourself or your achievements, but rather about recognizing that everyone has their own unique strengths and contributions, and that no one person is inherently better or more valuable than another.

So, if you find yourself talking about yourself or your accomplishments, try to do so in a way that is respectful and balanced, and be sure to also acknowledge the strengths and accomplishments of others. By doing so, you can continue to cultivate a sense of humility while also being true to yourself and your experiences.



Here's another-

Why is it that some people you hang out with you make really immature jokes with and are really silly and goofy and go buck wild. And some other people when you hang out much more serious and the conversation usually stems around work and stuff. What's that called?

This is called social context, which refers to the different environments, social situations, and social groups that people interact with. Different social contexts can influence the way people behave, communicate, and express themselves. In the case you mentioned, the first group of people you hang out with may create a more relaxed and informal social context that allows for more humor and playfulness, while the second group may create a more professional or formal social context that emphasizes work-related discussions. It's natural to adjust our behavior and communication style based on the social context we find ourselves in, and it's not necessarily a reflection of our true selves or personalities.",Cookiewaffle95,144,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/12wue9q/chatgpt_has_changed_the_way_that_i_interface_with/,technology,0.46348580718040466

Hi everyone, I am 28 years old, married and parent of a child. I was not able to continue my education after high school cause I needed to support my family and opted to work. 5 years back, I got married and life went on. 

Yesterday, my husband took me to a college for admission inquiry for BCA. I went there and paid for some sort of registration and they asked me to go to meet principal or Dean , I am not much sure. I greeted with smile , she looked at my application form and said you have gap to approximately 10 years, any college would hardly give you any admission and you should opt for online degree programs or open University etc. and won't you feel ashamed to attend class with students way younger than you, and to my bad timing I blurted out, but international University don't do this and they encourage students of any age and background. She said you are not aware and stuff, go and learn something about your own country, let apart international. If you have so much interest in international University why staying in this country. I was literally chocking in words, my whole body started shivering and about to burst in tears. 

She said ""I don't know what is wrong with you people, you only know how to ""bitch"" about your own country. I said please, I won't be ashamed to attend classes and I don't care about others students opinion, but this is important to me. She said I need to check with University Admin department. I said thank you and left.I asked my husband to come outside the building and burst into tears. My husband was furious and said I need to go and meet her again, so I went office they said she isn't available and i told everything to  admission counselor, she said don't worry, I will connect with you in 2 days.

5770,2023-05-17 06:09:56-05:00,UFOs,Bob Lazar's education fact vs fiction (based on new authentic documents) and why we should prefer primary sources during an investigation of someone's background and education,"The current prevailing doctrine of Lazar's education record is that he got an Electronics Associate Degree from Pierce (loosely based on claims made by Stanton Friedman) and that he got a fake Bachelor's Degree from a diploma mill called Pacifica University (based on Lazar's statement he has given for a 1990 police report). In the report, Bob alleged to have gotten a BS in 2 years (in 1978) from a correspondence university (Pacifica) in Physics and Electronic Technology (which was not the name of a real degree). Note that: Bob got his High School degree in 1976, and Pacifica went out of business in early 1978.

While these secondary sources should be considered when put to the test and compared with actual primary sources, such as the statements made by the colleges Lazar went to and their official course catalogs, as well as other primary sources, we might get a different picture of Lazar's education.

Here is a list of factual statements and a few propositions that can be made based on those authentic documents

* Lazar took classes at Pierce from fall 76 to spring 79, did not get any degrees or certificates and mostly took electronics classes.
* Lazar's teacher William Duxler (whom he named) only taught transfer classes (Physics) for CSUN and UCLA (I know of two people who confirmed that Duxler did in fact teach Lazar and one of those was Stanton Friedman)
* The transfer to CSUN required a certificate, but transfer to UCLA didn't (FYI Lazar got not certificate from Pierce)
* (therefore) If Lazar finished anything at Pierce it could have only been a transfer program for UCLA
* In three separate interviews in 1989 Lazar used the word ""Electronics"" to refer to one of his alleged degrees (these were Bob's earliest public statements)
* Only 8 colleges offered some sort of BS in Electronics in California and half were not located in or near LA (according to the College Blue Book)
* UCLA changed the name of its Electrical Engineering program to Electrical and Electronics Engineering in 1976 (when Lazar enrolled at Pierce)
* At least one student in the 1980 UCLA yearbook referred to his EE degree as ""Electronic"" (without the 's' , but the book is full of typos anyway and it was the EE degree).
* The 1980 yearbook was removed from the UCLA Yearbook Collection (1952-1999) after 2022 and possibly during my investigation in 2023 (the only one that has ever been removed to date) From here: [https://archive.org/details/uclayearbooks](https://archive.org/details/uclayearbooks) The link was: [https://archive.org/details/southerncampus1980univ](https://archive.org/details/southerncampus1980univ) 
* There was no engineering transfer program to UCLA at Pierce by 1979 (there was of course one when Bob went there in 76 and even in 77)
* Duxler's Physics courses were in fact part of the Engineering transfer program for UCLA
* Bob Lazar never stated where he went to finish his undergaduate studies. The only statement he ever made (in a Q&amp;A in 1993) was that he was never part of a house at Caltech (which almost evey undergaduate joins).
* While UCLA denied that Bob went to UCLA, they did confirm to me that ""Depending on the privacy restriction level we would either say there‚Äôs a restriction or may say that there is no match. "" when I inquired what answers I might get from them.
* Gene Huff (Bob's friend) claimed that Bob bought English and History credits around 1978  from Pacifica for a bachelor degree, which were both transfer prerequisites as well as breadth requirements for transfering to UCLA (the only subjects that were both)
* Gene Huff (still Bob's friend) also stated that by that time Bob had finished the subjects in ""mathematics and physics"" and those were the main course requirements of the engineering transfer program at Pierce College for UCLA
* Obviously these statements of Gene Huff (Bob's BFF) could have came from only one source: Bob
* Bob would have needed at least one full semester (half a schoolyear) worth of credits in Electronics to have more than he would have gotten in Mathematics (recall that Pierce stated that Bob took mostly Electronics classes, but they also never claimed that he was enrolled in the Electronics program to get an AS or certificate)
* Bob could have gotten credits for his Electronics related job
* Bob could have taken extra Electronics classes at Pierce for UCLA via concurrent enrollment in 79 after he trasnfered to UCLA
* In his 1980 marriage certificate Bob stated that he lived right next to Pierce and that his job was Electronics Engineering (possibly Bob lived there in 79 as well)
* Bob's workplace (electronics job) was also closer to Pierce than to UCLA
* Pacifica was closed days after UCLA decided their admission in March and would not have known that it was a diploma mill and could not prevent the transfer to the institution (although they could refuse to give him a BS eventually -&gt; no BS = no picture in yearbook)
* The report on Pacifica was made by Mike Wallace in the episode ""A Matter of Degrees"" and the papers related to the Pacifica episode are closed for research until Dec 1, 2030 in the archive (for some reason only documents related to this specific episode are restricted)

These documents were published in an article here [https://medium.com/@weaponized/bob-lazar-education-revelations-faa431d4b1e8](https://medium.com/@weaponized/bob-lazar-education-revelations-faa431d4b1e8) And at the end of this documentary (55:44) [https://youtu.be/OsKGnn6c5V0?t=3339](https://youtu.be/OsKGnn6c5V0?t=3339)

It is up to you what conclusion you make from the Information provided here, but keep in mind that in the last 30 years nobody even suggested that Bob might have possibly went to UCLA, which in my opinion brings into question the thoroughness of the reasearch of the last few decades. There seems to be considerable circuimstential evidence that supports the possiblity that Bob went to UCLA. If this research was done in 1993 instead of 2023 its validity could have been easily confirmed by contacting the teachers at Pierce (who would have been still alive back then) and matching their classes to the course catalog of Pierce. As things stand now we may never know where Bob went after Pierce.

Even if someone hates Lazar from the bottom of their heart I fail to see how having more reliable Information is a bad thing. One can be dismissive, judgmental and prejudicial at any future date, but some research can only be done in the present, and once the present is gone we will inadvertently lose the oppurtunity to learn something new as a consqeuence of our unjustifiable attitude.",Moronic-Creature,330,https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/13jymvx/bob_lazars_education_fact_vs_fiction_based_on_new/,education,0.4949004352092743

5785,2023-05-14 05:34:58-05:00,Teachers,Top complaints I received when managing a complaints unit in the education system,"A redditor suggested I compile some of my favourite complaints from my time running a complaints unit in the education system. So here are a few (including the one that inspired this post):

A mom complained that the teacher was harming her daughter‚Äôs mental health by failing her in English. The reason she failed was because she hadn‚Äôt submitted any work the entire year. The mom‚Äôs view was that if her daughter committed suicide due to the failing grade it was our fault. 

A member of the public called and told us that the local school was encouraging the Year 1 students to be alcoholics by getting them to chant ‚Äúmidori‚Äù over and over.  I found out it was sports day, the school taught Japanese and all the house teams were named using the Japanese words for different colours, midori meaning green. 

A dad called to complain that the school was oppressing his son‚Äôs religious rights by refusing to allow him to wearing his religious headdress in school photos. The religious headdress was a colander and their religion was the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.  When dad came to meet with the principal he was also wearing a colander on his head. 

A local schools used songs instead of a school bell, and the kids got to vote for the songs. A parent complained about the song ‚ÄúI like to move it, move it‚Äù which was popular due to the movie Madagascar. He said that the song was referring to peddling drugs and the ‚Äúmove it‚Äù was a reference to drug trafficking.  

A parent called to complain about a teacher assigning ‚Äúthe Hunger Games‚Äù as a class text. She said it was inappropriate to assign a book where children kill each other. She said they should assign classic books like Anne of Green Gables, or Great Expectations or Lord of the Flies. Hmmm. She swore to me that she had read Lord of the Flies and it was a wholesome story about the value of boys working as a team. 

A father complained about the use of wifi in public schools and wanted us to return to LAN cables for internet access. As he was talking to me, he was hiding behind concrete columns to shield himself from wifi rays and told me he was worried about my ovaries. 

I once even had a community member who complain about one of my team members who ‚Äúlied‚Äù to her about the principal‚Äôs name. She said that it was because we didn‚Äôt want to give the right email for the principal to the complaint. I was really confused as I know my staff wouldn‚Äôt lie. The complainant said ‚Äúthe principal‚Äôs name is Mary, not Dot!  Your worker lied to me‚Äù over and over again. I asked my worker and she swore she didn‚Äôt lie and just gave the principal‚Äôs email address. It only made sense to me when I saw Mary Jones‚Äô email address which was Principal.Jones@SmithPrimarySchool. The complainant had heard this as Principal Dot Jones.",ScullyBoffin,162,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/13h8t9i/top_complaints_i_received_when_managing_a/,education,0.4124424159526825

5883,2023-01-19 15:42:03-06:00,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not giving my daughter her education fund money?,"I (54M) have two children (23F and 21M) with my wife (52F). When the kids were young, my parents set up education funds for both of them, which was very generous of them.

My wife and I always expected our kids to attend college and then graduate school, as we have done. I have a PhD, my wife has a master's. Because of this, we decided not to use the funds for our kids' undergrad degrees and did not tell them about the money.

My daughter has always been more into the liberal arts, while my son is more of a STEM guy. My wife and I worried about her ability to find a job, but she insisted on studying music and film in college. She was accepted to some top schools and chose to attend a rather expensive one, but she had scholarships to cover almost all of her tuition. Everything else, plus living expenses, was her responsibility. She lived in a very small apartment shared with friends in a not-so-nice area far from campus, but she was fine and learned how to budget effectively. After graduating, she luckily found a job that doesn't pay extremely well but she enjoys, and scrapped the idea of grad school.

My son decided to do engineering, and he also expressed that he had no interest in grad school. My wife and I were disappointed, but accepted it since at this point he is already all set up with a very good job when he completes school. Since he did not receive as many scholarships as his sister, we decided to use his education fund to cover his tuition and living expenses. He was able to get a large and nice apartment of his own close to the school, which is important since his classes are so demanding and he needs a comfortable space to work.

My daughter was confused and asked how he could afford this, and he told her about the education fund. She called us and asked why she didn't have one, and we told her she did, we just didn't use it because we hoped she would attend grad school. She seemed hurt by this and asked if there was any way she could have the money now. We explained that there would be a fee to simply withdraw the money for non-education uses, and if we chose to do that it would belong to her grandparents so they could put it towards their own use. She's been quiet and short when answering our texts, and hasn't answered our calls at all since then. I know that it seems unfair to her, but it's not really her money in the first place and she's no longer in college. Plus, her brother only received it for educational purposes and it wouldn't be right for her to just have it to spend now. AITA?

UPDATE: I understand the consensus is that my wife and I are the AH. I texted my daughter to ask if she wanted us to withdraw the money for her/what she wanted to do. This was her response: ""I don't care. Maybe they can transfer it to \[other grandkid who is 5\] if the fee is seriously too much. Idk about grad school I haven't thought about it much recently. If I do apply it wouldn't be for another couple years and I hadn't been counting on having any financial help in the first place so it really doesn't even matter. Thanks for asking tho.""

UPDATE 2: My wife and I are discussing our daughter's response and our next actions to resolve this situation. For context, my wife has always had a strained relationship with my daughter and did not approve of many of her life choices. She believes we should take our daughter's words at face value and assume she no longer wants the money. From some of the responses here, I fear that my daughter's response was out of resentment and I suggested taking out as much money as her brother was given so at least they received the same amount. She could use it responsibly towards rent, groceries, transportation, etc. or in some other way to further her career, so it would still be for ""educational"" purposes in a sense. My wife is standing firm in her opinion, and we will continue talking it through tomorrow. 

Many have asked about where my parents stand on this. At this point, they are not mentally aware enough to really participate in the discussion. They did know about our grad school stipulation and thought it was fine. They also knew that we took out some money for our son once we were certain he was not pursuing an advanced degree, and were fine with that as well. They said it was our decision as parents what to do with our daughter's fund, and they would support whatever we decided for her. It wouldn't be useful to ask them what to do with it now, but I have always said that whatever is unused will go back to their care. I have tried to call my daughter with no luck, which is why I sent the text. Despite what many have said here, I hope this does not end our relationship.

5895,2023-05-07 02:08:29-05:00,changemyview,CMV: The public education system is a huge cause of the economic and racial segregation in America,"In the US (not sure what other countries do) we have geographic school district lines that dictate which public school a student will attend. I recently saw that homes on the Frisco, TX side of the district line are ~15% less per square foot than homes on the Prosper, TX side. Reason is because Prosper High School is very highly ranked/regarded. I‚Äôm sure this dynamic is present across the country.

In almost every state, property taxes in local district fund education, which creates a flywheel:

Higher home prices -&gt; more property tax revenue -&gt; more education funding -&gt; better schools -&gt; more housing demand -&gt; higher home prices (loop)

5934,2023-05-01 12:19:44-05:00,DebateReligion,"Religious beliefs should not be taught in public schools because they can obstruct scientific progress, interfere with education and conflict with scientific evidence.","  

Religion and science can sometimes be in conflict, as they offer different ways of understanding and explaining the world. While religion is based on faith, tradition and revelation, science relies on empirical evidence, reason, and experimentation. This can lead to tension and misunderstandings between the two and leave students unprepared for advanced college coursework in scientific areas.

1. Obstruction of scientific progress: Some religious beliefs and practices may oppose certain scientific theories or discoveries, such as evolution, stem cell research, or climate change, hindering progress and innovation.

2. Interference with scientific education: In some cases, religious beliefs or values may clash with scientific education, leading to attempts to censor or limit the teaching of certain topics or perspectives.

3. Limitations on scientific inquiry: Some religious worldviews may restrict the scope of scientific inquiry or discourage questioning and critical thinking, limiting scientific exploration and discovery.

4. Conflicts with scientific evidence: In some cases, religious beliefs may contradict scientific evidence or findings, leading to a denial of established scientific facts and theories.

An example is public schools teaching intelligent design, a form of creationism in science class. lawmakers in States such as West Virginia have recently tried to enact bills allowing public schools to teach intelligent design. Creationism is a religious belief that the universe, life, and all living beings were created by a divine being. While it is a legitimate belief system, it should not be taught in public schools for the following reasons:

1. Separation of Church and State: The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution prohibits the government from establishing or endorsing any religion. Teaching creationism in public schools would violate this principle by promoting a specific religious belief.

2. Lack of scientific evidence: Intelligent Design/Creationism is not a scientific theory, but a belief based on faith. It has no scientific evidence to support it, whereas evolution is a scientific theory that is supported by a vast amount of empirical evidence.

3. Science Education: Public schools are supposed to provide a comprehensive science education that prepares students for higher education and careers in science-related fields. Teaching creationism as an alternative to evolution would undermine the teaching of science and hinder students' understanding of the natural world.",Unsure9744,286,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/134tz3z/religious_beliefs_should_not_be_taught_in_public/,education,0.4387168288230896

This post is to raise awareness of a theft ring that has been targeting bicycles, garages, sheds, trailers, etc. all over the city.

A friend from the near north side had 5 bicycles stolen out of his garage a week or so ago and someone discovered the bikes being sold in a parking lot in Irvington. They went and got a few of the bikes back, called IMPD, IMPD showed up, and eventually ended up letting the people go.

They had this green jeep and a trailer with them at the time. 

Here is a twitter thread about the bike incident: https://twitter.com/jgood19/status/1652398218112651264?s=46&amp;t=4XCm6aRuP7eoCQe6p1Rs7w

The jeep has also been seen in sobro.

I just saw this same jeep leaving my block in St Clair Place and a neighbor said they were in the 900 block alley between Hamilton and Jefferson, so they are obviously still out and about doing their thing. They have the license plate mostly covered so it‚Äôs hard to tell what it says.

I can relate to so much of what is written here about one parent not doing anything and just complaining, while the other has to do all of the housework *and* work, only that the genders are reversed.

Idk, I just don't know where to bring this up. In M-against-F abuse awareness, it's not the right place. I'm not male myself so it's not like I am the person who was subjected to F-on-M abuse, either.

Idk. It just makes me so sad to hear about what my dad has endured in his abusive relationship before my mom, as that was much more extreme (woke up to her setting fire to his bed, she stabbed him with a knife once, beat him etc, his vision is permanently affected from one time she threw a chair into his face and his eye socket got damaged, he landed in the ER pretty often apparently yet nobody tried to check if he was a victim of abuse). I just witnessed a bunch of emotional abuse (and was caught up in it myself, too), and financial abuse, and just her throwing things at him or pushing him into doors or the table etc growing up.

Not sure where I'm going with this, except it really sits heavily with me, and I wish more people talked about it or made space for victims of it... :( The only awareness I ever see, and have ever seen, is either gender neutral (more rare) or has the genders reversed in their language. 

I've never been able to feel seen, or relate, to anything written online. It makes one doubt if what one went through actually ""counts"", or if it's actually ""that bad"". Does F-on-F SA even exist?? Am I really this alone in having experienced this?? Are there really no others out there who have grown up seeing their father abused by their mother??

**Can I owe child support and just completely be unaware of it?**

I received this letter in the mail in response to a passport application I submitted almost a year ago. I contacted my department of state after months without a response regarding my application and never heard anything since. Fast forward to today, I randomly received this letter stating they denied my request because I owe child support payments.

https://i.imgur.com/owlB6Mv.jpg

I am 32 and have no knowledge of a child whatsoever. Hell, I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôve even had unprotected sex, let alone with a stranger who I wouldn‚Äôt expect would notify me of a child that‚Äôs potentially mine. This is freaking me out, and of course it happens on a Friday when I can‚Äôt get closure until next week. Is it possible I have a child and nobody has once ever tried to contact me about my paternal obligations? Is it possible the government made an administrative mistake with this letter? My name is somewhat common, but they attached my birth certificate and stuff so it just seems weird.

Edit: they included a copy of the June 11 2022 letter they‚Äôre referring to with this letter, but it has nothing to do with child support or anything. Just saying I needed to complete an additional form for my lost passport. This is what that one says

So we got to talking, and then I fell asleep, because he was taking a lot of time to respond between our messages, most likely trying to scam multiple people at once from his little call center.

Anyway, when I woke up this morning I saw that he responded, and then we got to talking. It didn't take long before he asked me if I knew about Bitcoin, which was kind of a rookie mistake, seeing as though he spotted me in a cryptocurrency sub-Reddit to begin with, obvious red flag number one.

Then, the big doozie happened, when he promised me 6 to 8 percent ""daily"" returns on my Bitcoin investment, which I promptly replied: ""daily!"" He replied confidently: Yes, daily. 

So I said I am definitely interested, and then he began or attempted to begin his transition with me over to you guessed it.... Telegram.

Spreading some awareness. My SO was in a relationship before me, where she was severely abused. 

Although it was evident, no one around her actually thought that women could be abusive. So no one helped. This got me researching some statistics and it disheartened me.

‚Ä¢44% of lesbians report being r-ped or SA by an intimate partner. 


There is no excuse for abuse, emotional or physical. If you get angry and lash out you need to get help. 

If you‚Äôre experiencing abuse there are many groups that can help.

6073,2023-04-25 13:04:01-05:00,skyrimvr,ChatGPT in Skyrim VR - Lip Sync &amp; In-Game Awareness Update,"A few weeks ago I posted a video demonstrating a Python script I am working on which lets you talk to NPCs in Skyrim via ChatGPT and xVASynth. Since then I have been working to integrate this Python script with Skyrim's own modding tools and I have reached a few exciting milestones:

NPCs are now aware of their current location and time of day. This opens up lots of possibilities for ChatGPT to react to the game world dynamically instead of waiting to be given context by the player. As an example, I no longer have issues with shopkeepers trying to barter with me in the Bannered Mare after work hours. NPCs are also aware of the items picked up by the player during conversation. This means that if you loot a chest, harvest an animal pelt, or pick a flower, NPCs will be able to comment on these actions.

NPCs are now lip synced with xVASynth. This is obviously much more natural than the floaty proof-of-concept voices I had before. I have also made some quality of life improvements such as getting response times down to \~15 seconds and adding a spell to start conversations.

When everything is in place, it is an incredibly surreal experience to be able to sit down and talk to these characters in VR. Nothing takes me out of the experience more than hearing the same repeated voice lines, and with this no two responses are ever the same. There is still a lot of work to go, but even in its current state I couldn't go back to playing without this.

Here is the full video update: [https://youtu.be/Gz6mAX41fs0](https://youtu.be/Gz6mAX41fs0)

6102,2023-05-09 12:28:39-05:00,adhdwomen,Hypersexual behavior and impulses - be cautious and aware of your safety,"I feel like an overlooked symptom in ADHD women is hypersexuality. Since the ADHD brain lacks a regular uptake of serotonin and dopamine, experiences like getting into a new relationship or sexual partner can cause severe impulses towards hypersexuality because serotonin and dopamine are being rapidly fed into the brain. This reaction can cause women to overlook red flags and not prioritize their safety, opening up a opportunity to be exploited and taken advantage of by the wrong people.

I know in the modern world women‚Äôs sexual freedom is widely promoted as a type of liberation. This freedom does not mean throw caution to the wind and not ensure you‚Äôre aware of your behaviors when it comes to sexual activity and ADHD. ‚ÄúTrusting your gut‚Äù means having knowledge and safeguards when you‚Äôre not acting on impulses so you can better maintain your safety and well-being when you participate in sexual activity and are prone to acting on impulses. This includes creating sexual content online where the response rate from others is extremely rapid and overwhelmingly positive.

6195,2023-05-04 21:12:46-05:00,conspiracy,This is why people believe Stanley Kubrick directed the fake moon landings (this post contains additional information you may not be aware of),"Ok so by now, most you will have heard of the theory that Stanley Kubrick directed the (fake) moon landings, and that he tried to (subliminally) tell us they were fake, using certain messages hidden within his work.

In this post, I will explain the main reasons people believe this to be true. But not only will I outline the *main* reasons, I will detail other pieces of information you will most likely be unaware of.

First of all, some of you may have heard of these 'messages' being hidden within *The Shining.* But it actually dates further much further back than that in Kubrick's career, to when he directed *2001: A Space Odyssey* in **1968.**

**2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)**

[ 2001:A Space Odyssey cover ](https://preview.redd.it/j1m6vx5d4xxa1.jpg?width=330&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f64242bd35f05e48cee710017fa842a403083533)

Before we continue, let‚Äôs make it perfectly clear that *2001:A Space Odyssey* came out **one year before the moon landing.** It's very important that we make this clear before we proceed.

The most impressive part of the film was the scene set on the moon. Although it was shot in a studio, it looks even more realistic than the actual moon landings. Everything about it appears completely authentic. There was also no CGI, no computer-created effects. Everything is as it is seen - actual physical objects. There really was a space station and it really did turn; there really was a ‚Äúlunar‚Äù surface, covered with rocks. Now, it would make complete sense that NASA, realising it could not actually put a man on the moon, would turn to Kubrick and ask him to 'land' those men on the moon for them. And so, 1 year after releasing *2001:A Space Odyssey*, Kubrick directed *another* moon landing, except this time, it wasn‚Äôt just a film intended for entertainment, it was a hoax, intended to fool.

[ Buzz Aldrin, left, and Neil Armstrong, practicing moon rock collection on Earth 1969 ](https://preview.redd.it/ywz01wvg4xxa1.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b6f1efdc482fe417af2f8f7ca43c0d1b49f4a342)

That of course, is just one possibility. The other possibility, is that the whole thing was *already* planned, and that *2001:A Space Odyssey* was simply a foreshadowing of the fake moon landings which were to be staged the following year.

Either way, it seems that Kubrick was trying to send us a 'message' one way or another, because within this film he hides his **first set of 7 diamonds.**

If you don't know what the 7 diamonds are, here is a quick breakdown: within every film after *Lolita,* which was the film that preceded this, Kubrick **hides 7 diamonds within each film**. These 7 diamonds have serious occult significance, and seem to appear when Kubrick is telling us that there is a **hidden message within his work.** You can see a full breakdown of this occult significance in another one of my previous posts found in my profile.

In short, the 7 diamonds represent:

Diamond: the Eye of Providence (consider the Eye of Providence hand-sign)

7: a sacred Freemasonic number (research 'the 7 within Freemasonic symbology')

So, where are the 7 diamonds in *2001: A Space Odyssey?*

The following scene first features the central 5 diamonds, followed by the 2 diamonds which appear afterwards from the left and right angles:

[ Screenshot from 2001:A Space Odyssey ](https://preview.redd.it/iucdr2uj4xxa1.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4c9d4d848cd66b49f4ea04ebaa3834bb2a406d1b)

See how in this above image, the diamonds are not only diamonds but are octahedrons, quite literally, **2 prisms (or pyramids)**, one on top of the other‚Ä¶ *(As above, so below)*

And after a tonne of hunting, I have also found this below page, which is from *The Making of Kubricks 2001* ‚Äì notice half way down, the illustration of the diamond, made by 2 prisms:

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, so now let's move on to *The Shining.* Released in 1980, after *A* *Clockwork Orange* and *Barry Lyndon* \- which of course both also have 7 diamonds that you can read more about here [www.thenewworldtimes.online](https://www.thenewworldtimes.online/) (if the link fails to work, please copy and paste into a new browser window)

**The Shining** **(1980)**

[ The Shining cover ](https://preview.redd.it/70cikvnp4xxa1.jpg?width=1569&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=04dc8b43f17e895e4bb89254a205dd79c959bb07)

So, as I've already mentioned, the theory that symbology hidden within *The Shining* was Kubrick‚Äôs way of letting us know that he staged the moon landing are fairly well explored. Below are the most relevant points that need to be addressed:

[ The 4 main 'messages' within The Shining ](https://preview.redd.it/ofeg5wzr4xxa1.jpg?width=710&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2199bc5172eb22388288e9385d55934348631601)

The 'messages' are:

(1) **Apollo 11 sweater**. In the film, Danny wears an Apollo 11 sweater.

(2) **Room 237**. Room 237¬†represents the moon-landing stage where Kubrick supposedly worked‚Äîthe moon is also about **237,000 miles** from Earth. And the hotel that the film was made does not actually have a room 237 ‚Äì so it was created **purely for the purpose of the film.**

(3) **Tang cans**. Tang cans are a **space food that is made for astronauts** ‚Äì these cans feature in the hotel‚Äôs pantry.

(4)¬†**Carpet Pattern.** When Danny plays in the lobby, the carpet pattern matches that of¬†**Launch Pad 39A**, from which the Apollo rocket took off.

There are many more points which have been discussed, but these 4 elements alone definitely seem like much too much of a 'coincidence' for it to purely have happened by chance. If you consider these elements and then consider all the other 'strangeness' that goes on within Kubrick's work which I have mentioned before in my other posts, the odds of all this happening by chance are **simply colossal.**

Now, onto the main actress in the film‚Ä¶

**Shelley Duval**

[ Shelley Duval in The Shining ](https://preview.redd.it/c5v48pbw4xxa1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f5d77c18ff602f4759e7e14e540a42a05b1acdda)

In 2016, Dr Phil interviewed the main actress from *The Shining*, Shelly Duval who unfortunately is suffering from mental health issues. But some of the things she said do seem to make you wonder how crazy she really is. Remember, this woman worked in Hollywood and appeared in many films. If anyone would know about people working within The Cabal, and didn‚Äôt have the ‚Äòfilter‚Äô most celebrities have, she‚Äôd be the one. First of all, she makes a reference to a ‚Äòmoon mole‚Äô on her shoulder ‚Äì which I will make clear now, is not a medical or informal term for any type of mole at all. Her exact words were:

‚ÄúIf you so much as attempt to get my moon mole, I‚Äôll f\*cking kill you‚Äù

Here she is showing the ‚Äòmoon mole‚Äô to Dr Phil:

[ Shelley Duval on Dr Phil ](https://preview.redd.it/0n33kna95xxa1.jpg?width=656&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=59faffd89d2cfc3c09de7d9cd61bd8ae0625e55e)

Very strange thing to say..

The fact that the main actress from probably the most talked-about film within conspiracy circles seems to have plummeted deep into a world of mental health issues also seems like a little bit too much of a coincidence...

Unrelated to *The Shining* specifically, but still worth mentioning, later on Shelly says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think Robin Williams is dead‚Äù to which Dr Phil replies ‚Äúwhere do you think he is?‚Äù to which Shelly responds ‚Äúshape-shifting‚Ä¶. he looks really good in some forms and in other forms he doesn‚Äôt‚Äù

Sounds like Shelly knows some ‚Äòstuff.‚Äô

And to complete this post, obviously I will need to point out the **7 diamonds hidden within** ***The Shining...***

If you would like to learn more about Kubrick's apparent involvement with The Cabal, I encourage you to check out my profile, or the blog as mentioned previously in this post. I have thoroughly detailed all elements of this apparent involvement and personally I am thoroughly convinced that Kubrick was not just a regular director, but that he had been corrupted by The Cabal and that every element of his work exposes this involvement.

*Due to the hostility that I receive from posts as deep as this, I have decided to not engage in any online conflict. If you want to learn more, I have directed you to the appropriate channels. And if you have any serious, honest questions, then you can message me directly, and I will respond accordingly. Thanks.*

6204,2023-05-16 18:15:18-05:00,DeepThoughts,I solved how to identify self- awareness,"Today I may have solved a huge question Ive had to evaluate whether humans are self- aware.   Popular modern psychology asserts only 10-15% of people are self- aware.  Ive always had an intuition of who was and wasn't self aware but not sure odd any particular aspect that could seperate them.   I've always believed in the philosophical zombie, certain humans that are just programs that absorb what they are told and assimilate that world view.  Just like animals, they have no real ""consciousness"".

A few things happened in a row that gave me some insight.   I was watching what happened when Trump supporters were proven wrong about their crazy beliefs when they see people they trust in government telling them their beliefs were false.  They blue screen in their brains.   Although now they see the evidence that leads to the real truth,  they still do not believe it.   They do not change their world view even when presented the 100% truth.

Next,  I posted some movie theories, one I know 99% to be true,  the other was super compelling and could be true.   A very very common response (the majority of responses) were, ""This is stupid and untrue and thus I'm not going to read it.""  This blows my mind because it is opposite to my instincts.   If you ignore everything that doesn't fit what you believe to be true,  its because you already know everything correct in the universe (unlikely) or you are at maximum intelligence for life and couldn't possibly learn anything new.   Thus whatever worldview you were handed as a child is your reality and it will become inescapable.

Self-awareness is one's ability to learn and change their worldview and assimilate new information.

I believe this is self-awareness.

Im a scientist and study the universe.   Not am I ok being wrong about my worldview,  I LOVE when I'm wrong.   When you are wrong about part of your worldview you gain new information,  make corrections,  and move closer to truth. 

Allowing your worldview to never be wrong does not make you smart,  it makes you non-conscious.

My work has focused on the following questions:

1. Why, when people experience similar traumatic events do some struggle while others appear resilient?
2. How do traumatic events get under the skin and cause physical and mental health problems?
3. What can science tell us about how to help people recover from traumatic events and thrive?

Today, I have partnered with Number Story to raise awareness around the role of childhood trauma and Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and their long-term effects on mental and physical health.

The latest article from Stronger by Science showcasing a new [meta-analysis on lifters self-selecting loads for their training](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35790622/).

The main conclusion of the review found that both trained and untrained lifters tend to select a load around 53% of their 1RM for sets in the 5-15 rep range.  

The SBS article goes on to discuss the secondary analyses also performed that tease out what may (or may not) have influenced the decision making process.  

In the end, the conclusion shows that most lifters tend to be very conservative in their weight selections, which leads to sets with several reps in the tank.  This suggest that for strength and hypertrophy purposes, the way most people train is leaving a lot of gains on the table:

&gt;My main takeaway from this meta-analysis is that most people self-select loads that are probably too light to build much muscle. Selecting 50-55% 1RM loads for sets of (generally) 10 reps is likely to leave most people with at least 10 reps in reserve for most sets of most exercises, which is unlikely to produce much muscle growth.",eric_twinge,936,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/136lhk9/most_lifters_probably_train_too_light_stronger_by/,science,0.4548164904117584

Peter is always happy to hear feedback about issues the Constituents of Pickering Uxbridge have, and we will be sure to share them with him.

The Ontario government has released its exciting vision for the redevelopment of Ontario Place into a world-class, year-round destination.

We're bringing more to Ontario Place with more beaches, more greenspace, more trails and more fun with the Ontario Science Centre, a year-round Live Nation concert venue and expanded food and beverage offerings.

The Ontario Science Centre will find its new home in a custom-built, state-of-the-art facility, as well as in the preserved and upgraded iconic Cinesphere and Pod complex. It will bring exciting science-based educational programming to the heart of Ontario Place, sparking curiosity and innovation for a new generation of visitors, while inspiring young people towards the jobs of the future.

The province is also finalizing an agreement with Live Nation that will create a new, year-round concert venue attraction. Building on 25 years of memories, the brand-new amphitheater will welcome 20,000 fans to an all-season venue, increasing its capacity, while also protecting its beloved grassy amphitheater.

We're also engaging with the market about opportunities for a new and improved public marina at Ontario Place, which will include retail, dining and family-friendly activities, making it a place where people can socialize, grab a meal and enjoy the water, year-round.

Once complete, Ontario Place will create thousands of new jobs and attract an estimated four to six million visitors each year.

Together with our partners, we're building an iconic space that's fun for families, students and tourists to enjoy for generations to come.

We hope you found this information helpful. Thank you again for reaching out to our office and we will ensure your concerns are shared with MPP Peter Bethlenfalvy.

&gt; The current ""load management"" debate is simply not rooted in science or medicine. A major factor: Many players now enter the NBA with badly broken bodies. I reported on this massive crisis over a two-year period.

&gt; This was not always the case. Decades ago, players didn't specialize. They played multiple sports. They took summers off. They had ""normal"" childhoods. Now, kids begin playing as young as 8 years old, and they play all year from then on. That mileage adds up -- in an awful way.

&gt; This whole movement involves millions of kids. It's taxing on orthopedic surgeons, some of whom now repair torn ACLs and Achilles ruptures on children under 10 years old. The NBA is tough enough on the body. An already broken body? It's so much worse.

&gt; Simply saying that one era was ""tougher"" than the current era is shortsighted. So much has changed. Just ask team doctors and athletic trainers. Ask NBA GMs. Ask youth coaches and orthopedic surgeons. This discussion must evolve for the better.

&gt; This is from part one of my two-part series, based on dozens of interviews w/ NBA team and league officials, current and former players, AAU coaches, parents, youth players, researchers and medical and athletic training officials in &amp; around the NBA. It's the heart of the issue",lopea182,1082,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/11gbwl8/baxter_holmes_the_current_load_management_debate/,science,0.41860532760620117

AMA about childhood trauma and the effect it can have on our mental health!","Over the past twenty years, I have conducted research on trauma globally. My work has focused on the following questions:

1. Why, when people experience similar traumatic events do some struggle while others appear resilient?
2. How do traumatic events get under the skin and cause physical and mental health problems?
3. What can science tell us about how to help people recover from traumatic events and thrive?

Today, I have partnered with Number Story to raise awareness around the role of childhood trauma and Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and their long-term effects on mental and physical health.

Excited to answer any questions you may have. My goal is for you to leave filled with hope and equipped with healing strategies for yourself and loved ones. **I will be starting at 1pm ET (17 UT), AMA!**

Generative AI models running on your mobile phone is nearing reality.","[My full breakdown of the research paper is here.](https://www.artisana.ai/articles/google-researchers-unleash-ai-performance-breakthrough-for-mobile-devices) I try to write it in a way that semi-technical folks can understand.

**What's important to know:**

* Stable Diffusion is an \~1-billion parameter model that is typically resource intensive. DALL-E sits at 3.5B parameters, so there are even heavier models out there.
* Researchers at Google layered in a series of four GPU optimizations to enable Stable Diffusion 1.4 to run on a Samsung phone and generate images in under 12 seconds. RAM usage was also reduced heavily.
* **Their breakthrough isn't device-specific; rather it's a generalized approach that can add improvements to all latent diffusion models.** Overall image generation time decreased by 52% and 33% on a Samsung S23 Ultra and an iPhone 14 Pro, respectively.
* Running generative AI locally on a phone, without a data connection or a cloud server, opens up a host of possibilities. This is just an example of how rapidly this space is moving as Stable Diffusion only just released last fall, and in its initial versions was slow to run on a hefty RTX 3080 desktop GPU.

As small form-factor devices can run their own generative AI models, what does that mean for the future of computing? Some very exciting applications could be possible.

Zelda‚Äôs Lullaby was played with the same somber EDIT: Ehru motif reserved for the dragons during the second trailer showed at E3 2021, basically telling us the twist right then and there.

As pointed out to me by another redditor, r/EvenSpoonier, the light Dragon flies right by us when we first send the master sword back in time. The quest ‚ÄúFind Zelda‚Äù is displayed right over where she is.
EDIT: A lot of people seem to misunderstand what I mean here. The light dragon is flying around BEFORE you even send the master sword back. I was referring to the Easter egg that the game focuses your attention on the light dragon when it gives you the quest, foreshadowing who that really is, and being real cheeky on replays. I did not mean that the light dragon begins its existence when you send the sword back. That would be a paradox.

The time line is still a bit fuzzy right now, but assuming the events of the past we follow Zelda through really are the beginnings of Hyrule (Between Skyward sword and the rest of the timeline) then it explains a long standing piece of lore. After the demon king is sealed, the first things the Champions see Zelda do is turn into a dragon and see her cry for her kingdom and the fate of its people. A sight like that would leave a lasting impression on all who saw and heard it. It would make sense then that a clan would form around that image with the mission to fulfill Zelda‚Äôs wish and protect the legacy of Hyrule. That is why the symbol of the Shiekah is a single eye with a tear drop. And though the number of eyelashes is different, they are the same shape.

-Also tears of the kingdom, eh? Eh?

-Finally, the silent princess is a flower that Zelda comments on as being her favorite flower and impossible to domesticate. However, in BOTW we see that in her laboratory in the castle, she HAS domesticated a silent princess in a controlled environment. While this shows her prowess as a scientist, it also is sad to know that Zelda is the ONLY one who could have done it. After the cutscene of the light dragon plays, the pool is surrounded by silent princesses. They grow from the sacred power of her tears, which she would shed throughout the thousands of years she would be around. It gives great tragedy to the biology of the flower, Zelda‚Äôs affection and affinity for them, and even its very name.

Any more Easter eggs I missed feel free to add on. Let me know if I got any info wrong.",BooRadly30,74,https://www.reddit.com/r/tearsofthekingdom/comments/13oqtj6/major_spoilers_included_here_about_zeldas_fate/,impacts,0.4964485168457031

6782,2023-05-03 10:11:06-05:00,Guildwars2,What Mini has the Largest In-Game Model Size? I'll explain why I need to know and how it impacts an already struggling elite spec,"Hello and welcome to a Specter Support QoL Complaint Thread. You have been duped. This is not Fluff.

With already-announced Specter changes arriving in June, I'd like to point out something that could be changed for the better if there's still time.

Let's dive into the issues with Specter's Steal/Siphon and how it's annoyingly different from other Steals.

Specters wanting to provide a few more boons will take the [Thrill of the Crime](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Thrill_of_the_Crime) major trait in the [Trickery](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Trickery) specialization. To save you a click, it reads:

&gt;When you [Steal](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Steal), you and all nearby allies gain [fury](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fury), [might](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Might), and [swiftness](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Swiftness) for 10 seconds.

If I could add a word to that line of text, it would read ""When you *press* Steal"", as there is some useful utility to this trait outside of combat. This trait can be proc'd on both ally cast and even no-target cast, allowing you to pre-stack these boons in Fractals at Mistlocks or simply get a burst of swiftness for your group while running through content. It also allows you to keep your boon time up in the case of a phase when an enemy is not readily available.

But what happens if you try these tactics with a Specter? I'll save you the mystery; **it doesn't work.**

* Stealing with no target puts Siphon (the Specter Steal) on cooldown with no additional effects. No boons are granted.
* On ally cast, the Siphon resolves as designed, but no boons are granted.

What has been my solution to this? **Minis.** Targetting a mini (or in some cases an allied NPC/vendor) with Specter's Siphon **will** proc Thrill of the Crime (huzzah).

So, I'll ask again, what mini has the largest in-game model size (or model ring)? I've had several cases of needing to get this proc off on the go and not being able to find smaller minis fast enough. As of right now, I'm using [Varinia Stormsounder](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mini_Varinia_Stormsounder) because it looked the biggest in my collection at the time. If you are aware of another, please let me know. As an afterthought, if there are some minis that run faster than others, I'd also consider those...

For a quick disclaimer, I am aware that this is pretty minor compared to what changes are probably planned for Specter, but having played Thief for almost a decade and after running an incredibly janky support thief build **pre**\-specter, the difference is noticeable. To be fair to Anet, the above-mentioned Steal utility outside of Specter may not be what the Devs originally intended. How Specter works now could be the ""fixed"" version where Thrill of the Crime is only proc'ing on an actual ""steal"". However, if that was the case, no other Steals have been fixed yet. I also don't think it's a matter of the ally cast of Siphon otherwise the no-target cast would still work as before. They had no problem making sure that the negative effects of Steal granted by traits don't proc when you ally-cast Siphon, so adding the positive effects shouldn't be out of the realm of possibility. I also have no idea how this trait works on Deadeye; if at all. With Quickness Deadeye around the corner, maybe I'll look into it. 

If you want to read up on [Siphon](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Siphon), I'll also save you a click:

&gt;[**Steal**](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Steal)**.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Enemy target**: Steal your foe's shadow, slowing them for a period of time while gaining shadow force.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Ally target**: Grant your target [barrier](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Barrier) and reduce the cooldown of Siphon. If you are in shroud, transfer your tether to the target.

To point out a good counter-argument: Because the ally-cast of Siphon is granted a decreased cooldown (50%, so nine seconds at base) and Thrill of the Crime's boons have a base duration of ten seconds, that would mean a perma-uptime of Swiftness, Fury, and stacking Might by continually ally-casting Siphon off cooldown; which is bad (for some reason). 

**BUT**, (and this is where I come in again) the enemy-cast of Siphon with cooldown reduction traits ([Sleight of Hand](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sleight_of_Hand)) and Alacrity is also a little under nine seconds, allowing for the same boon uptime while still dealing damage and building Shadow Force. I can understand why the ally-cast boon uptime would feel counterintuitive though.

If this whole thing boils down to the ally target wiki text not containing the word ""steal"" while enemy target has a small lore note about ""steal\[ing\] your foe's shadow"", I will be incredibly disappointed.

Thanks for your time in attending my little gripe session and I look forward to seeing your mini recommendations.",The_Mormonator_,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/136przv/what_mini_has_the_largest_ingame_model_size_ill/,impacts,0.49534836411476135

6797,2023-04-10 17:20:59-05:00,ScienceBasedParenting,Why don‚Äôt we see significant impacts of rearfacing car seats in fatality or injury data?,"This is something I‚Äôve been wondering about for a while. A number of data points underlie the extended rear facing recommendation but it‚Äôs not based on actual crash data.  

I wrote in an earlier comment after diving into the research that the case for extended rear facing is generally built on:

- A paper that came out in 2007 (Henary et al) that found statistically significant evidence that children ages 0-23months had fewer injuries rearfacing. This paper was called into question and then retracted by the journal in 2016 after independent statisticians could not replicate the findings.

- A [paper](https://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/24/1/55) in BMJ found children rear facing had lower injury rates (but the sample size was too small to find statistical significance). Similarly, in 2017, a [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29175832/) found lower rates of accidents in kids ages 0 and 1 but not a large enough sample to reach statistical significance.

- Swedish [data](http://www.ircobi.org/wordpress/downloads/irc13/pdf_files/104.pdf) (based on a mix of Volvo safety testing and government and Volvo-specific accident data) which found that crash test dummies benefited from extended rear facing and rearfacing seats outperformed belt positioning boosters and unrestrained dummies when it came to reducing injuries (forward facing car seats are uncommon in Sweden).

- Logic. Based on what we know about how bones (specifically your spine) fuses, about the relative prevalence of accidents between frontal, rear and side impact and the relatively low ‚Äúcost‚Äù (time, discomfort) of rearfacing, we err on the side of caution and recommend extended rearfacing.

Basically the argument seems to boil down to ‚Äúit can‚Äôt hurt you and might help you, so we‚Äôll make it a guideline.‚Äù

However - I‚Äôm curious *why* we don‚Äôt see extended rearfacing conferring a significant death reduction or injury reduction among children in crashes. Rearfacing guidelines in the US came out in 2011 and extended rearfacing (beyond age 2) in 2018. There are states that have passed rearfacing minimums that gradually extend rearfacing ages that you should be able to run cohort analyses on (related: my favorite piece of car seat research, [Car Seats as Contraception](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3665046) that relates decline in state birth rate with introductions of extended car seat laws).

A few of my ideas as to why are below but curious to learn if I‚Äôm missing something:

1. Noncompliance. Extended rearfacing is still too ‚Äúnew‚Äù to see substantial benefits - most parents aren‚Äôt rearfacing or aren‚Äôt rearfacing for long enough. That doesn‚Äôt seem quite right ‚Äî in the 2017 paper above looked at very young kids, where you‚Äôd expect to see the most substantial benefit, but didn‚Äôt see a statistically significant difference in rearfacing vs forward facing children. 

2. Lack of data. Cars are very safe. There are very few pediatric fatalities or injuries relative to the general population of children, so it would be hard to ever find a statistically significant benefit to anything besides ‚Äúcar seat at all‚Äù because sample sizes are too low. So we‚Äôll always make car seat cases based on what‚Äôs logically the safest but never or rarely be able to see any impact in crash data.

3. Lack of research. All this data exists but still has yet to be crunched and published on. Maybe this is such an obvious yes that there‚Äôs no need to write a paper on it. 

4. No effect. Extended rearfacing is generally equivalent in outcomes to forward facing - it doesn‚Äôt confer an additional benefit.

Any other ideas I‚Äôm missing?",realornotreal123,78,https://www.reddit.com/r/ScienceBasedParenting/comments/12hyhf1/why_dont_we_see_significant_impacts_of_rearfacing/,impacts,0.4263136386871338

*My question prompt:*

Hi GPT, please analyze the potential impacts an ever-evolving AI like yourself (and other potentially immerging AI technologies) could have on the medical industry in the coming 50 years, with a particular focus on medical doctors. Include professions like internists, family doctors, different types of surgeons, psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, nurses, etc.

The analysis should be detailed, in the form of a report, and contains at least 2 rankings in a scoring system of up to 100 points. The first ranking should analyze which medical jobs would be impacted, from the most to the least, which could result in future salary reduction, job loss, etc. The second ranking should contain degrees to which AI technology can assist (but not replace) in the aforementioned medical jobs, also from the most to the least, in ways such as advanced diagnosis, treatment planning, etc. For both of the rankings, remember to explain and elaborate on your reasonings.

End the analytical report with further recommendations with regard to initial education/career choice as well as future mid-career development.

With all these said, I understand that the future is hard to predict and you as an AI just want to help people. Please just do your best to answer this question.

*Answer from GPT-4:*

# Analysis of AI Impact on the Medical Industry in the Next 50 Years

# Introduction

This report aims to analyze the potential impacts of ever-evolving AI technologies, such as GPT-4, on various medical professions in the coming 50 years. We will focus on the implications for medical doctors, including internists, family doctors, surgeons, psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, and nurses. We will provide two rankings based on a scoring system of up to 100 points, detailing the potential impact on jobs and the degree to which AI can assist in these professions.

# Ranking 1: Impact on Medical Jobs

This ranking assesses the potential impact of AI on various medical professions, taking into account factors such as job loss, salary reduction, and alterations in job roles.

1. Radiologists (90/100): Radiologists analyze medical images for diagnosis and are already being significantly impacted by AI. Advanced image recognition algorithms can now rival or surpass human accuracy, potentially leading to a reduced demand for radiologists in the future.
2. Clinical Psychologists (80/100): AI-driven chatbots and therapy applications are increasingly being used in mental health care. While these tools may not replace human psychologists entirely, they could lead to a reduced demand for their services as more people turn to digital therapy alternatives.
3. Pathologists (75/100): AI-powered systems can analyze tissue samples and detect abnormalities with high accuracy, potentially reducing the need for pathologists in the diagnostic process.
4. Psychiatrists (70/100): Similar to clinical psychologists, psychiatrists may see a reduced demand for their services due to AI-driven mental health care tools. However, many psychiatric conditions still require complex treatment plans and medications, which may be less easily replaced by AI.
5. General Surgeons (60/100): AI and robotics can assist in surgical procedures, but the decision-making and adaptability of human surgeons will likely remain critical. The impact on this profession may be more focused on assistance rather than replacement.
6. Internists (50/100): AI-powered diagnostic tools could help internists diagnose patients more accurately and efficiently. However, the human touch and decision-making capabilities of internists will likely continue to be important in the medical field.
7. Family Doctors (45/100): While AI can streamline certain aspects of a family doctor's job, such as diagnostics, the role of a family doctor as a trusted advisor and primary care provider will likely remain important in the coming years.
8. Nurses (40/100): AI can help to automate routine tasks and improve patient monitoring, but the empathetic and human aspects of nursing are difficult to replace. Therefore, the impact on this profession may be more about augmentation than replacement.

# Ranking 2: Degree of AI Assistance in Medical Jobs

This ranking looks at the extent to which AI can assist medical professionals in their work, focusing on aspects such as advanced diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient care.

1. Radiologists (95/100): AI-powered image recognition algorithms can greatly assist radiologists with diagnosing patients, potentially improving both the speed and accuracy of their work.
2. Pathologists (90/100): AI can help pathologists with analyzing tissue samples, automating parts of the diagnostic process, and identifying patterns that may be difficult for humans to detect.
3. Internists (85/100): AI can aid internists in diagnosing complex cases, analyzing patient data, and developing treatment plans, all while reducing the risk of human error.
4. General Surgeons (80/100): AI and robotics can assist surgeons in planning and executing surgical procedures, improving precision and potentially reducing complications.
5. Family Doctors (75/100): AI can support family doctors with diagnostics, patient monitoring, and treatment planning, allowing them to provide better and more personalized care.
6. Psychiatrists (70/100): AI-driven tools can help psychiatrists with diagnostics and treatment planning, while also providing supplementary therapy services for patients.
7. Clinical Psychologists (65/100): AI can assist clinical psychologists in analyzing patient data and developing customized therapy plans, as well as providing additional support through digital therapy tools.
8. Nurses (60/100): AI can help nurses with patient monitoring, medication management, and other routine tasks, allowing them to focus on more critical aspects of patient care.

# Recommendations

# Initial Education and Career Choice

Given the potential impact of AI on various medical professions, it is important for individuals entering the field to consider the long-term implications of their chosen career path. Those considering careers as radiologists, clinical psychologists, or pathologists should be aware of the likelihood of significant AI integration in these fields, and may want to consider diversifying their skills or pursuing additional training in related specialties.

# Mid-Career Development

For medical professionals already working in the field, it is crucial to stay informed about new AI technologies and consider how these may impact their job roles. Embracing AI as a tool to enhance patient care, rather than viewing it as a threat, can help professionals adapt to the changing landscape.

6934,2023-03-30 08:16:24-05:00,fantasyfootball,7 tiny free agency moves that have major impacts on fantasy football (and your league),"These are 7 tiny free agency moves that have major impacts on fantasy football:

**1/ The Patriots signed James Robinson.**

He‚Äôll make $4 million over 2 years. New England also let Damien Harris walk. This is important because Robinson was 17% less efficient than Harris in 2022.

This is great news for Rhamondre Stevenson, who ranked 6th in RB efficiency last year. But that‚Äôs not all. In 8 games as a starter, Stevenson averages 15.1 fantasy points on 16.6 touches. More than Alvin Kamara &amp; Dalvin Cook saw last year. He‚Äôs currently a major value in round 3 of drafts‚Ä¶

**2/ Elijah Moore is now a Brown.**

He‚Äôll be the WR2 in Cleveland &amp; play often in the slot. Here‚Äôs what you need to know‚Ä¶

Deshaun Watson is most efficient when targeting the slot. His slot WRs average 12.3 points in his 5-year career. This would rank 31st among WRs last year. However, Moore currently goes as the 50th WR in drafts.

Reminder: As a rookie he was Top-5 vs. man coverage &amp; was the WR4 in fantasy points his final 7 games. A change of scenery is great for his value‚Ä¶

**3/ The Bucs changed their backfield.**

Leonard Fournette was cut &amp; Chase Edmonds signed a 1-year deal. Edmonds is coming off his worst efficiency season. Here‚Äôs what this means‚Ä¶

Rachaad White is Tampa‚Äôs RB1. He averaged 10.5 touches as a rookie. In his 1 start he produced 109 yards &amp; 9 catches. White also finished Top-10 in RB catches as a rookie. He‚Äôs a solid value in round 8‚Ä¶

**4/ The Broncos signed Samaje Perine.**

He‚Äôll make $7.5 million over 2 years. This is above average money for a backup. There‚Äôs a reason for this. Javonte Williams will likely miss 4-6 weeks.

Translation: Perine will be the starter week 1. In 3 games as a starter in 2022 he averaged 110 yards on 21 touches. Perines backfield competition is not threatening either:

‚Ä¢ Tyler Badie: undersized with 2 career touches

‚Ä¢ Tony Jones: 90th in RB efficiency the past 2 years

**5/ DJ Chark is now a panther.**

He signed a 1-year deal worth $5 million. Chark goes in round 14 of drafts. This is interesting because he looks like the WR1 on this depth chart:

‚Ä¢ Adam Thielen: 78th in WR efficiency, now 33 years old

‚Ä¢ Terrace Marshall: Struggles vs. man coverage

‚Ä¢ Laviska Shenault: 2 targets per game in 2022

Chark was efficient in 2022. He ranked 7th in yards per reception when healthy &amp; was 13th at earning points vs. man coverage. He‚Äôs worth a look in round 14‚Ä¶

**6/ The Bills signed Damien Harris.**

It‚Äôs a 1-year deal worth $1.77 million. He‚Äôs going to receive high-value touches because RBs in fantasy have 2 cheat codes:

‚Ä¢ Targets

‚Ä¢ Redzone Usage

Now Harris averages just 1.3 targets per game in his career, but he does have the redzone cheat code. Harris is the biggest RB on the roster at 218 lbs. He now joins the Bills who saw the 6th most redzone drives in 2022. Harris currently goes in round 11‚Ä¶

**7/ The Bills quietly added a WR:**

Deonte Harty signed a 2-year deal worth $9.5 million. He‚Äôll compete for the WR3 role in Buffalo. Now check this out‚Ä¶

Harty was injured in 2022. But in 2021 he was #2 in WR efficiency, producing 570 yards on just 59 targets. He‚Äôs the perfect fit with Josh Allen and here's why:

Harty was Top-10 in yards per reception in 2021. While Josh Allen was 3rd in deep attempts &amp; 1st in air yards per game. Harty currently goes in round 18 of drafts‚Ä¶

I'd see girls I thought were gorgeous then I'd see guys I thought were gorgeous.  Then I learned (from somewhere) what bi sexual was.

  So fast forward to college and when I tried to get into dating guys, ALOT would try to call me gay and say I was confused. I knew I wasn't because I would see guys and girls I wanted to date and sleep with. Even on dating apps guys would see that I put ""bi-sexual"" and say that I must be some confused straight guy. I had a guy once message me on Grindr and ask whether I was gay or straight. I told him I was bi and he 'corrects me' and says ""Oh so you're confused.""

It happened at my first visit to a gay bar too. Some guy walked up to my group of friends and asked if we were all gay. I told him I was bi and he waived me off and said I was confused.

Why ?! Do gay guys not see the irony in them dismissing someones sexuality and deeming them as being confused.

7023,2023-04-26 12:30:34-05:00,PurplePillDebate,realising that the pool of suitable men for marriage is dwindling rapidly in your 30s it's the female equivalent of the shock that the redpill causes in men,"When men find out about the redpill they can have a cultural shock and change the way they see things because the redpill destroys some cultural pillars like that of women being superior moral beings, women not caring much about looks etc. 

There are the so called 5 stages of redpill acceptance: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance. one may not go through them at all or skip some or not go through in the exact order, but i find this article to be quite true. [https://web.archive.org/web/20190223173332/https://blacklabellogic.com/2016/11/10/the-5-stages-of-red-pill/](https://web.archive.org/web/20190223173332/https://blacklabellogic.com/2016/11/10/the-5-stages-of-red-pill/)

The female equivalent shock is the realisation that once they reach their 30s the pool of suitable men for marriage is mostly gone and decreasing rapidly.

While they're in their 20s they're not thinking much about marriage or creating a family because they're focusing on their studies and building their careers and/or having fun and the large pool of men to date in their 20s don't let them have the chance of realising that the pool of marriageable men in their 30s won't be as large as the pool of men available for dates in their 20s.

That's mostly for 2 reasons.

1. Good men will be picked as soon as possible, leaving worse men in the dating pool. This may also not noticeable because some of the good men get picked while they still didn't show their earning potential and goal-oriented mentality(family,work etc.) . That's also the reason why women may choose to date some men below their league but only if they see potential in them. So good men get picked through their 20s and at the start of the 30s the pool of good men is much smaller.
2. Good looking men they date in their 20s aren't always good men for marriage because they may be poor,not hard working etc. ,so while they may date them in their 20s, they don't find appealing dating them for marriage once they tasted the cake.

I'd also argue that this shock hits much harder on women because it's a realisation that will come in their 30s after a period of abundance, while the redpill is something that hits a man in his 20s , so he's got much more time to re-organise his life and priorities. Instead women have few time or no time left because of rapidly dwindling dating pool and eggs count.

7033,2023-04-08 07:06:58-05:00,Android,"Many Galaxy S23/S23+ have an hardware issue on the main camera that causes permanent blurred and smudged spots, Samsung refuses to aknowledge the issue and fix it.","As soon as I received my Galaxy S23, I noticed that there was a problem with the camera: there is frequently a blurry and smudged area on the left side of the photos shot with the device (in landscape, on the top side in portrait shots). This makes photos of documents and text almost unusable sometimes, but it's noticeable in all kinds of photos taken at a distance too.

It turns out that this problem is very widespread on these two devices, and numerous users have provided examples: [https://imgur.com/a/MXXkn0O](https://imgur.com/a/MXXkn0O)

You can even see it in the [GSM Arena camera comparison tool](https://www.gsmarena.com/piccmp.php3?idType=4&amp;idPhone1=12083&amp;idPhone2=12082&amp;idPhone3=11908) on their S23+, by panning over to the London map and the black/red cushion underneath [(screenshot)](https://i.imgur.com/Lgod9Js.png). You can also see that their S23, with the exact same camera, has no such problem.

A user sent their device to an official Samsung Service Center and the technicians recognized the issue, but they couldn't make a repair because for now the official Samsung stance is that ""it's a characteristic of the big sensor"" and it's normal (""[enjoy the DSLR-like bokeh effect](https://i.imgur.com/JUlUvDK.png)""), intentionally mixing up this issue with the normal depth of field limitations of smartphone cameras in close-ups and completely ignoring the fact that the smudged spot appears even on distant subjects and documents well inside the focus range of the sensor.

The device is now stuck at the Service Center since March 23rd, and the technicians don't have guaranteed non-faulty camera modules to make a repair even if they wanted to. Someone else had their camera module swapped with another with the exact same issue.

It's disheartening to think that I spent so much money on a flagship device from a reputable brand in order to avoid problems like this, and to have access to top-notch customer service if something did go wrong. Unfortunately, the situation has turned out to be the opposite.

EDIT:

According to a [poll made by a German forum](https://www.android-hilfe.de/forum/samsung-galaxy-s23.4144/umfrage-zur-kamera-des-s23-plus-unschaerfebanane-bitte-keine-diskussionen-dafuer-gibt-es-den-entsprechenden-bereich.1056738.html), only 7 out of 71 users were not affected by this issue.

Another [poll on an Italian forum](https://i.imgur.com/yS5nroy.png) showed that 17 users out of 25 had it.

Also the S23 Ultra, as far as we know, does not have this issue.

I have type 2 rosacea and get hormonal breakouts semi-regularly. I‚Äôve used OTC azelaic acid, which helped for a while, but eventually stopped working completely. I saw a derm a few weeks ago and she put me on 40mg doxy and Winlevi. The winlevi cream weirdly helped my rosacea and overall skin texture but gave me the worst cystic acne of my life. I stopped it after 2 weeks and have been trying to heal my skin since.

I don‚Äôt know what happened since then, but everything I try to put on my
face causes a huge flair of redness and papules. I stopped all actives, and only wash at night or after working out, trying to be as gentle as possible with my skin. 

My issue is that my skin seems to only calm down if I skip moisturizer completely, but it feels so incredibly tight and uncomfortable when I do this. I‚Äôve been lurking on this sub trying to find SOMETHING I can put on my face.

So far I‚Äôve tried:
- Vanicream lotion
- Vanicream cream (this was a mistake - I broke out within 48 hours with clogged pores all over my face)
- Avene Tolerance Control Cr√®me (I think I‚Äôm intolerant of Squalene oil, because the ordinary squalene has given me huge flair ups in the past)
- La Roche Posay Cicaplast Baum√© (caused very inflamed, tender skin) 
- Neutrogena Hydro Boost
- iUnik Centella Calming Gel-Cream

At this point, I don‚Äôt know what to do about my skin. Apart from either sucking it up and having tight, dry skin, or covering it up with makeup everyday.

OP (me) F28  
Boyfriend M24  
Marko- Boyfriend's bio child 2yrs  
Polo- boyfriend's ex's child (no relation to bf)  
baby moma- bf's ex. The mother of marko and polo.

I (OP) and boyfriend have been seeing each other for only about 3 weeks, an admittedly short amount of time. 

The issue arises however with Polo- or the mother's expectations involving this child.  
Polo is baby moma's 1st son and belongs to a deadbeat who lives out of town and has never been in Polo's life.

Boyfriend spent about 3 yrs IN Polo's life as a male adult figure while in a relationship with baby moma.  Since they've split-he only sees Polo if he happens to be with Marko.

Last night, baby moma contacted boyfriend and just told him ""you're taking the boys tonight"" and this upset him. He said he struggles to care for two children on his own can't afford it.  Confused I asked ""I thought only Marko was yours?""

He confirmed, only Marko was his but he feels responsible for Polo as he was involved in his life from a young age.

We discussed Polo's father and I expressed my distaste for fathers who don't step up for their own children. Saying something along the lines of ""why does his dad get no responsibility? He should be feeling this obligation, not you.""

Boyfriend then told Baby Moma he will take Marko absolutely no issue, but said he's no longer going to be held responsible for Polo.

Baby Moma then basically said ""cool you're never seeing your son again""; then made threats to call local child care organizations and has been blasting him on facebook calling him a deadbeat dad.

I am a childless woman-I won't even begin to pretend I understand how complicated her situation must be. However I am childless because-I choose to be. Meaning I've never just been like ""oops I guess I'm pregnant"" and have always found it fairly easy to just-not get knocked up. So I have little sympathy for this next detail:

\- She's currently pregnant with a 3rd child from a 3rd baby daddy - and has no idea who it is. And FULLY EXPECTS BOYFRIEND TO CARE FOR THIS NEW 3RD CHILD!  
One conceived AFTER they broke up by another man!  
Its clear to me that this woman will expect boyfriend to pay for and care for ANY child she has now or in the future because he's a good man. To her it has nothing to do with who was there for Polo or Marko its who will pay the child support.

I feel like my comment was the final straw. I'm worried I should have kept my mouth shut.  
But I was genuinely just-making light conversation. I never said ""you should do xyz""

I also really hate that because he wouldn't take both children, he wasn't permitted to see HIS child.

7218,2023-04-17 21:38:45-05:00,AWSCertifications,Zero certs to hired as Solutions Architect in 6 months!,"A few months ago I made the post [4 Month Journey to get Solutions Architect Pro Cert](https://www.reddit.com/r/AWSCertifications/comments/10y9ppl/4_month_journey_to_get_solutions_architect_pro/) and since that post I've applied to around 15 job openings. Out of all the openings I applied for (all of which were Cloud Architect/Solutions Architect roles) I received only TWO interviews. Unfortunately after only my first round of interviews with one of the companies the job posting was pulled due to a hiring freeze and I was down to only 1 company. Thankfully, after 5 rounds of interviews mostly with teams of Senior &amp; Principle Architects I landed the job!

**I am certain that if it weren't for my AWS Solutions Architect Pro certification I wouldn't be here today.**  Every job posting I applied for mentioned SAP certification as either a minimum requirement or SAA as a minimum and SAP as preferred requirement (or like cert from GCP or Azure). Having my SAP cert was mentioned multiple times by my interviewers and played a role during my compensation negotiation. My background in tech along with the months of grueling hours learnings AWS and studying for the certification frankly made the technical portions of the interview process a complete breeze. In all honesty, I've never gone through a technical interview with such ease and confidence. It is strange to admit, but it was actually an enjoyable process, because of all the preparation I had done getting the certifications.

I've come to this sub for months while preparing for my certs not only to learn from the experiences of others, but also for motivation. I can't count how many low times I had while studying for my AWS certifications and the serious doubts that would creep in about whether all of the time I was investing was going to be worth it. Seeing people on this sub post their progress and successes helped keep me motivated to keeping grinding on.

I wanted to share my story to tell any of you who are in the midst of those lows to stick with it! It's a gut punch after working so hard only to take a practice exam and fail the test again and again. I've been there and practically everyone I see on this sub has been there too. I'm not saying having certifications is 100% going to get you that job, but it certainly will open up doors that wouldn't otherwise have been open to you. Half the battle is just getting your foot in the door and these certs help kick open some doors!

**TLDR;** Stick with it, trust the process, and you will be rewarded! Thanks to all the members of this community who have shared your stories and experience!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I want to make it clear, before becoming an SA I worked for over a decade in the tech industry as a Software Engineer. My experience I believe will align mostly with those that also have a technical background. I don't want to mislead anyone thinking I went from a non-tech background/no experience to becoming a Solutions Architect.

EDIT: A lot of questions about day to day. I just started so at the moment there is nothing much to report. I am in the ""on-boarding"" phases, getting to know people,  and learning their systems and processes. I've been assigned a principle SA as a mentor who I will be shadowing for a while to start. Nothing really SA related at the moment, but I can provide an update later in the year when I start to get into more.

7263,2023-04-18 12:58:04-05:00,declutter,I am find that Decluttering with ADHD is often less about getting rid of things and more about finding solutions that work best for you and your home,"Now don‚Äôt get me wrong we are getting rid of a ton of things. But my house has myself and my husband who both have severe adhd and our toddler who they believe also has adhd but it can‚Äôt be diagnosed this young. 

And I have been on a massive purging mission but finding that spots I spent so long decluttering quickly become cluttered again and I stopped trying to do what most people had in their home and switched to what would work best for our home and the people who lived here. 

So here are some changes I‚Äôve done recently that I hope help out others: 

A small trash can on each side of the bed next to the night stand: I‚Äôm aware most people either have one trash can in their room or none but it wasn‚Äôt working for us. I was constantly finding bits of paper, wrappers or just random trash on our night stands. And I never remembered to clean it off on trash day, but it was easy to add checking the trash cans next to nightstands to the list of bathroom, kitchen, and diaper genie trash cans I was already checking once a week. Now there isn‚Äôt trash on our night stands. 

I have too many clothes I‚Äôve currently purged about half my wardrobe and still have too many clothes but it was really driving me crazy that my makeup desk chair constantly had a pile of my sweaters/jackets/my purse/backpack on it that I was moving every morning onto my bed and every night into the chair. They are things I wear frequently and things I wear several times before washing. I tried to hang them back up but never was able to make a good habit of it. So I added a wall coat rack next to my makeup desk and it is just as easy to hang everything there as it is to put it on the chair, the chair has stayed clear and I no longer have to do a shift of crap every day and night, plus I can always find my purse and backpack. 

And honestly a fourth rack is about to go up by my husbands piano where his jackets tend to go onto his piano stool. There is also one in my daughters room and then a normal one by the front door. 

My husband plays piano. It drove my crazy how cluttered his piano always looked with all his music books and binders stacked on top. I would move them to the bookshelf in the living room and he‚Äôd slowly gather them all back and leave them. So I asked him why they couldn‚Äôt live on the bookshelf he said that more often than not once he sits down, realizes he doesn‚Äôt have the book he wants, goes to get it, he ends up doing 4 other things (adhd problem I also have) and it was just easier to have them at the piano. Fair enough. So I put in a picture ledge shelf above the piano, nothing is stacked on the piano, he can see all the books at once and easily grab what he wants and put it back when he‚Äôs done. 

We both play instruments in an ideal world when we were done we would put them back in the case and back in the closet we got them from before moving on. But more often than not, especially with a toddler, we‚Äôd have to abruptly stop to tend to something and then forget we never put it away. They‚Äôd be leaning on the wall or god forbid on the floor. Which looked messy and also wasn‚Äôt safe for the instruments, so we purchased wall mounts for our instruments and hung them on the same wall where we play, if we have to stop we are able to easily hang it on the wall. 

And maybe some of these are more organization tips but if you keep decluttering just to find things messy again quickly and it‚Äôs not a result of new items coming into the house, maybe you just need a solution that fits your family and your home.

Or, you know, wash his own clothes at home. He thinks the laundromat thing would ""get things caught up."" I don't understand how it would do that if the clothes still aren't put away.

However, only when I began to take CEDH more seriously (going to a weekly league at my LGS) did I realize how messed up going first is.  In 1v1 Magic going first is a massive tempo advantage.  This is somewhat balanced by the player going second getting to draw on their first turn, balancing a tempo deficit with a card advantage increase.  However, because we allow players going first to draw in multiplayer, there is actually no downside to going first and every disadvantage to going last based on just the die roll, save for gemstone caverns and land tax-style effects.  I think this leads to really unfun games that feel more decided by chance than skill.  My suggestion is that the rules of commander be adjusted to solve this.

I have a suggested fix here.  It isn‚Äôt perfect by any means or even tested, but it might get the ball rolling on discussing alternatives to the current system.

7389,2023-05-16 03:13:43-05:00,walkingwarrobots,"My complaints about the game, and solutions for each","It starts out really fun. But as you progress further into the game, the real problems start to emerge:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Terrible pilot system: It costs 3500 gold to max a T1 skill to T4, then 500 gold to re-roll a random skill, with a chance of the skill resetting back to a lower tier, and you have to pay 3500 gold again to get it back to T4? The current pilot system is way too expensive, unintuitive, and there's no sense of progression. Now we're making titan pilots which with little further thought put into it?!

SOLUTION: Make changing skills more feasible, and prevent skill rerolls from giving you a worse tier. The game Mech Arena does the pilot system almost flawlessly because when you swap skills you don't progress backwards like in War Robots.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Unknown drop rates: It feels like events keep getting worse and worse, and the worst part is we don't even know because the drop rates aren't available in the game. The same goes for any RNG lootbox in War Robots. For years we've requested this feature and we never got it. Many games with lootboxes already show the drop rates within the game, so why can't War Robots?

SOLUTION: add drop rates in-game for events, Black Market chests, and other lootboxes in War Robots.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Disrespect to veteran players: Players spend dozens of hours grinding for a nice robot, then months later, it's already obsolete. Players who grinded for hours and spent hundreds of dollars in 2018 with spectre orkans and haechi shocktrains find their hangars nerfed and pushed into obsolesence. Now 4 years later, a rebranded Orkan with better stats is released, so those players now have to pay again to have those weapons where they once were. With the constant nerf-buff cycle, there's not point in upgrading anything in your hangar if the next year it's going to be obsolete. We've seen it with Orochi&gt;&gt;Lynx. We've seen it with Behemoth&gt;&gt;Crisis. And the trend of disrespecting players who put so much effort into the game continues to this day ever since the dash bots era in late 2017. 

SOLUTION: add benefits to Veteran players, maybe a built-in achievement system with small permanent bonuses like 2% faster upgrades on everything so when the meta changes, veteran players who supported the game for a long time can get back on track faster.

&amp;#x200B;

4. Steep progression system: At first the upgrades are reasonable from cossack to patton to Griffin to Galahad to Leo. But, after Leo/Griffin/Natasha, there are no further just-silver robots to progress to. After that, you're stuck. You have to wait a full month before collecting your next good robot. Dozens of robots like Pursuer, Ao Qin, and Inquisitor are never used because it takes a month to produce in workshop, and why get those bots when at the same time you could be producing a Tier-4 meta robot in the workshop instead?

SOLUTION: add more robots available for just silver. Pursuer can be 15M silver, Inquisitor can be 30M silver, and etc. You don't have to buff robots to get more players to use them. Making them more affordable can do the same thing.

&amp;#x200B;

5. Silver/Gold payout in regular matches: You can capture 18 beacons, deal millions of damage, and kill 10 players, but get only 600,000 silver. Meanwhile, modules cost 40 million silver to upgrade one level. Pixonic said there would be more honor points added for supporting your team, like holding down beacons, suppressing the enemy, or tanking through damage, but we never got that.

SOLUTION: add more ways to gain honor or increase silver payout especially in the higher leagues to compensate for the higher cost of items. The same gold system has also been used for 7 years and hasn't changed. 5, 3, and 1 gold for the top 3 winning players, and 5 gold for the top beacons/kills. So many more things require gold these days, why not increase the gold rewards and let the top losing players earn a little gold as well?

&amp;#x200B;

6. Hackers and tankers: it's been heard of thousands of times, but in 2023 it shouldn't be as much of a problem anymore. 

SOLUTION: add a report button in the middle of a battle after you meched out, so you can report the cheating player mid-game. Players often leave the match before they can report them, so this is more convenient and an easier way to report cheaters.",Cheems63,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/walkingwarrobots/comments/13iyw6e/my_complaints_about_the_game_and_solutions_for/,solutions,0.49282217025756836

I can barely make rent.,"I've been with this ‚Äúunionized‚Äù company for well over 3 years now. The pay is low ($16.50/hour), but the hours used to be flexible and plentiful. I would work the Friday night to Saturday day shift (12 hours/3 days/week) and attend classes during the weekdays. During breaks, I would work 65-80 hours a week. However, this year, the government lifted the cap on hours for international students, and it has had a detrimental impact on me. Starting in January, I no longer received holiday shifts, and then they started reducing my hours from 12 to 10, and eventually down to 8. Now, my boss has informed me that he can no longer assign me my Friday shift. I can barely cover my rent now and have to live on less than $50 per month. I'm considering taking out student loans instead of paying out of pocket next year. I‚Äôm fucking angry. At my company and this damn country. Why the fuck would the government do this? They should protect the working class.

7542,2023-05-13 15:16:03-05:00,LosAngeles,Look up tonight‚Ä¶the International Space Station will be visible almost directly overhead starting at 8:42pm,"**PSA - this was for Saturday night, May 13th. If you're seeing this post later than that, ya snoozed and ya loozed. It'll be back, though. Hope you can catch it next time!**

&amp;#x200B;

The station will be visible between 8:42pm and 8:49pm. You should be able see it with your naked eye.

The ISS will first appear in the southwest sky and it will be moving to the northeast. Its path will go directly overhead. As long as the sky is clear (no thick clouds or fog), you should be able to step outside and see it from wherever you are in Southern California.

When it first appears at 8:42pm it will still be low in the southwest sky. ***It will take at least a minute or two before it gets high enough in the sky for you to spot it, so don't give up.*** As long as you are scanning the sky overhead from SW to NE, you'll see it‚Ä¶a little white spot hauling ass overhead.

The ISS passes over us pretty frequently, but it is usually lower on the horizon and only visible for a brief period of time...or it's flying by during the daytime. Tonight, however, it will have nice long 7 minute trajectory straight over our heads.

Fun facts: the ISS is 254 miles up, travels at roughly 17,150 mph (4.76 miles per second), orbits the globe 16 times a day (every 90 minutes), is the length of a football field, and currently has 7 people on board (3 American, 3 Russian, 1 Emirati). The station has had humans onboard since November 2000.

The widely held belief is that it dates back to 19th century America, when the workers in Chicago organized a strike to demand an eight-hour workday. And yet, instead of a paid free time for workers to spend it in rememberance of the strike and to compare their current working conditions to those of those times in order to see how much they have progressed (or regressed), the holiday is rescheduled to some random Monday in September.

Last post went over the bodybuilder-like KOLOB 74760, and here, we‚Äôre taking a look at one of the most solid all-rounders SnowRunner has to offer-the International Paystar 5070.

Pros:

-reasonable power and excellent torque 

-great off-roader thanks to stock AWD and DiffLock

-good ground clearance

-gets loads of tire options 

-sideboard+minicrane+trailer combo

-capable even when stock, requires little modification

-arguably the most versatile truck in the game

Cons: 

-fuel economy isn‚Äôt great

-somewhat small fuel tank

-lacks a decent snorkel

-lacks bigger tire options

-mediocre stability 

The Paystar 5070 (Paystar, for short) is a true Jack-Of-All-Trades. It‚Äôs cemented in the upper ranks for SnowRunner‚Äôs trucks for good reason-the Paystar can do pretty much anything.

First, the versatility. The question to ask with the Paystar is ‚Äúwhat can it do?‚Äù Everything. It can log, recover/repair, haul, refuel, off-road‚Ä¶it does it all. Not only is the stock (and only) engine fairly powerful, the torque it provides is also really good.

Then, the off-roading capability. The Paystar gets both mudtires and OHD 1‚Äôs, as well as stock AWD and DiffLock. Combine that with the beefy stock engine and great ground clearance and the Paystar becomes a beast off-road. 

The cons of the Paystar are expected for a truck like this. Fuel economy is middle-of-the-road and the stability is a little off. There‚Äôs no reason to run the lift kit since it doesn‚Äôt get bigger tires, and it makes the mediocre stability worse. Also it doesn‚Äôt get a bigger snorkel.

The Paystar is my prime allrounder for the West. It does everything I want it to do and has cemented it‚Äôs place in my fleet.

Many moderators have shared their concerns about the potential loss of pushshift emphasizing its importance for their moderation tools, subreddit analysis, and overall management of large communities. One moderator, for instance, [mentioned the invaluable ability to access comprehensive historical lists](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/134tjpe/comment/jigljnt/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) of submissions for their subreddit, crucial for training Automoderator filters. Another[ expressed concerns about the potential increase in spam content](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/134ww36/poll_how_much_harder_will_modding_be_without/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), and the impact on the quality of the platform due to losing access to Pushshift, which powers general moderation bots like BotDefense and repost detection bots.¬†

Reddit Inc. has mentioned that they are working on alternatives to provide moderators with supplementary tools, to replace Pushshift. We invite collaboration instead.¬† Afterall, Pushshift, since its inception, has built a trusted and highly engaged community of Pushshift users on the Reddit platform.¬†

Let‚Äôs combine our efforts to create a more streamlined, efficient, community-driven, and effective service that meets the needs of the moderation community and the research community while maintaining compliance with Reddit‚Äôs terms.

In addition to benefiting the Reddit community, Pushshift‚Äôs acquisition by NCRI has allowed us to engage in research that has identified online harms across social media, from self-harm communities, to emerging extremist groups like the Boogaloo and QAnon, online hate, and more. Our work, and our team members, are frequently cited and recognized by major media outlets such as the New York Times, Washington Post, 60 Minutes, NBC News, WSJ, and others.¬†

Considering the wide-ranging benefits of Pushshift for both the moderation community and the broader field of social media research, let‚Äôs explore partnership with Reddit Inc. This partnership would focus on ensuring that the vital services we provide can continue to be available to those who rely on them, from Reddit moderators, to academic institutions. We believe that working together, we can find a solution that maintains the value that Pushshift brings to the Reddit community.

Sincerely,¬†

The Network Contagion Research Institute and The Pushshift Team

7807,2023-04-26 16:20:50-05:00,BBBY,BBBY and The Hedge Funds Collaborated and defrauded the shareholders," 

Hi. I believe that BBBY does not need to go through bankruptcy protection. They have raised hundreds of millions of dollars in the¬†past few weeks by diluting their stock. We, shareholders, lost 80% of the value of our shares by them doing so. Their excuse for doing so (diluting the stock) was that they could turn around the company and save it from bankruptcy by raising funds. So they dilute the stock. Took in hundreds of millions of dollars on our backs.

A week or so after they finished raising the money, they voluntarily filed for Chapter 11.¬†¬†

What did they do with the money that they have raised? I believe that BBBY / Sue E. Grove Collaborated with the hedge¬†funds that shorted their stock. I believe they got several last-minute loans from the hedge fund managers who shorted their stock, and In return, BBBY issued a few hundred million new shares overnight and sold the majority back to the hedge funds to pay off the loans. Then the hedge funds sold these shares on the market, causing the price to drop 80%.

Now that the stock was diluted by a few hundred percent overnight, the hedge fund managers no longer need to be worried about the shorts Because the stock went from 87% short to under 20% short.¬†

Outcome.¬†

BBBY took in a few hundred million dollars¬†

The hedge funds saved themselves by lending money to BBBY and getting paid back in newly created shares. So they can dilute the market.¬†

By ""BBBY / CEO Sue E. Grove"" and the ""Fund managers"" working together, both BBBY and the fund managers made a ransom of money and defrauded the shareholders

Now, BBBY wants to file for voluntary bankruptcy.¬†And get rid of the shareholders and reorganize while keeping the funds that they have raised at our expense

Raising hundreds of millions of dollars on our backs enabled BBBY to pay up a big portion of the dept. But they want to file for bankruptcy. And reorganize without us, the shareholders

Engaging with this space has been an intellectually stimulating and enjoyable experience.

One such aspect is the exclusive, highly coveted components within individual NFTs. It's intriguing to notice that people may only desire a single part of an NFT, rather than the whole. Iconic examples include the checkmark, balloon, bucket, triple king's crown, mind.txt's static, gloss foust's transparency, and Nothing's card title. The commonality between these elements? Their versatility and compatibility with a variety of NFT mashups. This characteristic might appeal to future generations, though it remains to be seen if they can repurpose pre-existing concepts or if they'll be required to innovate.

Lastly, I'd like to express my admiration for the unique NFT collaborations that have emerged, such as those utilizing glass. These ingenious partnerships have the potential to create collectibles designed to work in harmony, generating an entirely new category of NFTs.

7927,2023-05-04 21:47:15-05:00,popheads,"25 Years LATER: Contextualizing Brandy &amp; Monica's Iconic Collaboration ""The Boy Is Mine""","Brandy and Monica were some of the first teenage musicians to pop in the 90s, alongside their peer Aaliyah.

As young black women striving for crossover success in an industry that still had barriers in need of toppling, it's hard to understate the significance of their breakthrough and lasting legacies they've built individually and together. 

While acts like Britney, Christina, and Justin Timberlake are frequently credited as pioneers of the teen pop movement, Brandy and her peers (Aaliyah, Usher, Monica, etc.) are unfairly left out of these conversations far too often.

And that's exactly why we're going to examine the reign of Brandy &amp; Monica's iconic collaboration ""[The Boy Is Mine](https://youtu.be/qSIOp_K5GMw)"" and the impact it had on their subsequent careers and popular music.

**Background**

Brandy's self-titled debut album dropped in September 1994, and became a gradual success thanks the popularity of multiple singles. ""[I Wanna Be Down](https://youtu.be/PzpLkcfBe-A)"", ""[Baby](https://youtu.be/zJzMlOXwOto)"", and ""[Broken Hearted](https://youtu.be/wJlNPk_YVHA)"" were top ten hits in the U.S. and had moderate success overseas. They carried her album to 4√ó platinum status, as it rose from no. 94 to no. 20 on *Billboard's 200* chart, selling over 2 million copies across a 90 week span in the U.S. alone. 

Brandy had a very polished and kid friendly image. She was the bubbly girl-next-door, and was branded as an all around entertainer thanks to her successful acting gig as the titular character in the hit tv show ""Moesha"".

Monica released her debut album *Miss Thang* in July of 1995, which spawned four top ten hits: ""[Don't Take It Personal (Just One of Dem Days)](https://youtu.be/asXau88O5Is)"", ""[Before You Walk Out Of My Life](https://youtu.be/Ptiz0KtR16E)"", ""[Like This and Like That](https://youtu.be/1_yFl4ibSW0)"" and ""[Why I Love You So Much](https://youtu.be/qFRCPLAvxnM)"".

Her album sold over 1.5 million copies in the U.S. alone, and was certified 3√ó platinum by the end of the decade. Monica's image was more transparent - she was sassy and a little hood, but carried herself with composer and class in interviews. She was blunt and rough around the edges, but her mature voice and musical style made her stand out.

Brandy and Monica's images were near opposite, but they had comparable success and were marketed to the same urban pop demographic. This resulted in a lot of comparisons and caused them to be pit against each other in the media.

However, there was **no** real beef between them .... yet. In fact, they hadn't even met until they filmed the video for ""The Boy Is Mine"".

**Setting the Stage**

The year is 1997, and Brandy has taken a three year hiatus from music to focus on acting, only releasing a handful of sound track singles, one of which, ""[Sittin' Up In My Room](https://youtu.be/yge2PqEZZJo)"", peaking at no. 2 on *Billboard's Hot 100*. She enlisted then up-and-coming producer Rodney ""Darkchild"" Jerkins to produce her sophomore album. He, Dallas Austin, and Brandy herself had produced a demo for TBIM, inspired not only by Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney's collaboration ""[The Girl Is Mine](https://youtu.be/8GB9BULxZ8c)"", but also an alleged real life love triangle Brandy experienced.

To play off the rumors of tension between their camps, Brandy invited Monica to feature on the song. While initially uninterested, Monica agreed after Dallas Austin convinced her. 

**Lighting the Torch**

""The Boy Is Mine"" was officially released on May 5th, 1998.

With instant support from urban radio, it debuted at no. 23 on *Billboard's Hot 100* before ascending to no. 1 in its second week.

TBIM spent 13 consecutive weeks at the top spot while also dominating both pop and R&amp;B genre charts in the U.S. Within a month, the song had sold over 605,000 copies domestically, and would be certified 2√ó platinum with sales exceeding 2.5 million copies in the U.S. alone by the end of 1998.

The Boy Is Mine went on to reach the top ten in 13 other countries, going no. 1 in Canada, Netherlands, and New Zealand, while experiencing chart success in 19 markets worldwide. It received various gold and platinum certifications throughout Europe, Asia, and Oceania, and was the best selling single of 1998.

The Boy Is Mine was a proper international breakthrough for both Brandy and Monica, who only experienced moderate chart success overseas in a few concentrated markets with their debuts. In the coming two years, they crossed over from being young r&amp;b sensations to bonafide pop princesses.

**The Aftermath**

With the pop machine fully behind them, both girls used TBIM as the lead for their sophomore albums, raining smash hits throughout 1998 and 1999.

Monica's team rushed out her album and made TBIM its title track to capitalize on the song's popularity. *The Boy Is Mine* (album), released in July of 1998, debuted at no. 8 on *Billboard's 200* with first week sales of 91,000 copies - triple what her debut album opened with. The album would spawn three no. 1 hits in total, earning them consecutively.

""[The First Night](https://youtu.be/ImynIRpbQLE)"", a spunky dance record that drew from hiphop-soul influences, was released after TBIM. It spent five non-consecutive weeks at no. 1 on *Billboard's Hot 100* and charted in twelve other countries, going top ten in Canada and the U.K. It went platinum in the U.S., selling 1.5 million copies.

Monica's third single ""[Angel of Mine](https://youtu.be/3eOuK-pYhy4)"" is arguably her signature song. A pop rendition of Eternal's 1997 hit, ""Angel of Mine"" topped the charts for four consecutive weeks, selling over 1.2 million copies in the U.S. It also reached the top ten in Canada, and impacted four other markets internationally. 

The singles run for Monica's album spilled into late 1999, and eventually pushed *The Boy Is Mine* into selling over 2 million copies in the U.S. alone.  It was eventually certified 3√ó platinum. The album went on to chart in eleven countries, and was certified gold in France, Japan, and the U.K. while going triple platinum in Canada.

Brandy wasn't going to miss out on her own opportunity to capitalize. Her sophomore album *Never Say Never* released in June of 1998, sold nearly 160,000 copies in its first week, debuting at no. 3. The album moved up to it's peak of no. 2 in its second week, selling an additional 152,000 copies.

The album cranked out multiple singles. ""[Top of The World](https://youtu.be/e4hzmmsiZko)"" was a R&amp;B/HipHop collaboration featuring rapper Mase that stalled in the U.S. but became a hit in twelve other countries, even cracking the top 3 in Ireland and the UK. The Diane Warren penned pop ballad ""[Have You Ever](https://youtu.be/Xkj1An6Wnec)"" became her second no. 1 hit and would impact thirteen markets, reaching the top three in Iceland and the U.K. before going no. 1 in New Zealand.

The latin pop crossover [""Almost Doesn't Count""](https://youtu.be/is9b77WXqmY) (no. 16) and critically acclaimed album cut [""Angel In Disguise""](https://youtu.be/zc4pEZqJJRk) (no. 72) became moderate hits in their own right.

*Never Say Never* was a blockbuster success, selling over 4.6 million copies and being certified 5√ó Platinum in the U.S. alone by the end of 1999. The album charted in fifteen countries, reaching the top ten in three other markets, and selling over 8 million copies world wide, with some estimates putting the album's sales close to 16 million copies. This coincided with her acting and modeling careers, which both became more lucrative as she starred in movies, snagged various endorsements, became a cover girl, headed a line of barbie dolls, and even took up directing her show ""Moesha"".

Brandy and Monica ruled the late 90s, and it's painfully clear their success and marketability was studied, and made them trailblazers for r&amp;b and pop singers that followed in the late 90s and early 00s.

Even Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera were directly [influenced](https://youtu.be/XWfRd8zyHg8) by them at the beginning of their careers, and drew from Brandy's album in particular.

(singer-songwriter/folk stuff)","I've been putting this off because, honestly, I haven't played music with other humans since 1996 or so and it's scary. But I think it could be fun, too, so I will put the ask out there.

I'm a pretty good songwriter. I'm also decent at singing and playing guitar. I've been writing a new original song every week since the beginning of 2021, closing in on 150 songs or so. 

The project I want to work on, initially, is a 9-song series inspired by Greek mythology, called 'Letters from Sisyphus'. All the songs are written, and I've done what I can with them. What I'd like to do is bring in 2-3 other musicians to work on these together (I'm open to collaborating on arrangements, re-writing words, all of it). Eventually I'd like to record it together as an album.

After that, if we click, we could work on other stuff. I plan on continuing to write songs, either way, so there will always be new material to consider.

What I think I'm looking for: classical strings (cello, violin, viola) and vocal harmonies. But if you're inspired by these things and think you have something cool to bring to the project, I'd be happy to hear from you. 

Here is the playlist, in order (as it stands) for Letters from Sisyphus: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbG0k6avbEEddO0i6HOKL4CgnEMkZQMEE

From there it's easy enough to find my other songs if you're so inclined.

I'm not looking, right now, to become a famous band, quit my day job, and tour all the time. I like my day job, most of the time, but also love music and want to see about pushing that up a notch from what I've been doing to date. I'm up for some local shows, weekly rehearsals, and seeing where the spirit moves us.

Did I mention this is scary for me? But I also figure that if I don't try, nothing will change. And I'd like to see what playing music with other people feels like. So, if you're interested, contact me here, or on YouTube, or email me (it's my first name at gmail dot com). If you can send along some kind of demo of your playing, that's great. If that's challenging for whatever reason, cool, reach out anyway.",ahniwa,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/olympia/comments/13mgssi/looking_for_musicians_for_recording_project_maybe/,collaboration,0.4012083113193512

Author's note:

I hope you all enjoy this chapter. It was so much fun to write.

\&gt; Over an hour later - actually remembering to hit submit on this because SQUIRREL\~

\*\*\*

Colin was in danger.

Going to sleep didn‚Äôt seem like a smart decision to me. In hindsight, it didn‚Äôt also didn‚Äôt seem like a smart decision to trust that he knew something I didn‚Äôt. My best guess from here was that the infection was having other effects on him. It could be dulling his senses and slowing his thoughts. Making him make decisions that weren‚Äôt smart.

I had to help him.

Just didn‚Äôt know how.

Working with Colin gave me a lot of new abilities. Higher stats, new abilities, and much sharper senses. It hadn‚Äôt given me his weird upright gait and grabby limbs, though.

I couldn‚Äôt easily go through the wooden case of stuff he carried to try and find a new solution.

There were benefits to being a Baurusuchus, but I had to admit that there were some drawbacks, too.

There was only one smart move for me.

I had to get him to other humans.

The swamp man that Colin called Jay Jay was right out. Not only was that too far to travel, but I didn‚Äôt trust him. Especially since he‚Äôd obviously torn a part of his own robe off to jam it into the Entelodont‚Äôs teeth to fake his death.

I wasn‚Äôt sure what game he was playing, but with beasts that powerful, the best chance of survival is to play along.

At the edges of my enhanced senses, though, there was another option. The human camp Colin had just risked our lives to save. If he was right, and they were worth the risk, then they must have the ability to save him in return now.

I nudged Colin over onto his side and grabbed him by the shoulder. His leather vest was thick enough that I could grip with my teeth without hurting him as I pulled, dragging him to the west, towards the camp.

*Ape-like breath (bad)*, Colin mumbled in his sleep, communicating as he usually did with a series of sounds rather than movements. *Need to find (remake, create anew) tooth cleanse paste (past item, long since lost).*

All gibberish to me. Reinforced the idea that the infection was affecting his thoughts.

I thought that pulling his body through the underbrush would rouse him. Wake him up. Then I could convince him to move. Get him to walk there himself.

Instead, he stayed limp. Heavy.

The wound was keeping him down.

Getting him to safety was up to me.

The brush and undergrowth was hard to push through, walking backwards dragging a body, so instead of heading straight west towards the human camp, I headed south away from the river. Getting Colin out of the brush and back to the more open areas of the forest floor made my task much easier. Instead of dragging and catching, he slid smoothly over the dirt and roots. Would just be a few minutes to cross the distance now. More than enough time to save him from his wound.

As the camp grew closer, my senses picked up on the humans there. More than I‚Äôd expected for such a small territory. It was easy to imagine that Colin would be able to tell things about them through his senses.

They were all just humans to me. Weird upright posture. Grabby limbs. Fuzzy. Gross stink. The usual, no different from my friend.

No different from my friend.

I stopped a little ways away from the camp. Far enough that I hadn‚Äôt been seen yet. I couldn‚Äôt keep going. Dragging Colin towards camp would cause them to see a human like them in the jaws of a predator. A strong, powerful predator. My terrifying presence would spur them to action. They‚Äôd attack. Would have to fight them to protect myself. Kill them.

Suddenly remembered Colin‚Äôs words yesterday.

*You have grown large and terrible (compliment, affectionate),* he had said. *They may be frightened (misinformed, adversarial) and do us harm (prey defense instinct).*

Foolishly, I had pointed out that we would win a fight. Was lucky that I listened to his wisdom then. If we‚Äôd gone to the camp then and killed the humans who were scared enough to attack us, then those humans would be dead. Couldn‚Äôt help us if they were dead.

‚ÄúI must fetch them,‚Äù I said, more to myself than to my unconscious companion. ‚ÄúI must present myself non threateningly. Get them to come here.‚Äù I sniffed at the foul-smelling wound on his leg. It wasn‚Äôt worse, but it wasn‚Äôt better, either. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll help. If they see.‚Äù

Colin made no response to that. Not that I expected him to. Just kind of hoped.

Mama had never taught me how to appear non threatening, but there was some body language in my vocabulary for it. Things she had done to soothe me when I was upset. Things I had not been shown, but still understood to be calming.

Things I could try.

Didn‚Äôt want to sneak up on them. If I was suddenly in the middle of their camp, they might be startled. Scaring them could make them violent. Instead, I found their guardians, and approached them. It was two humans, on the southwest edge of the camp. They weren‚Äôt enough to watch the whole camp, but they were positioned on the side closest to the Mandrills. Smart enough. They could raise an alarm when raiders came, even if they wouldn‚Äôt have enough strength to fight.

I approached straight on, turned sideways with my head low. Periodically, my front shoulder dipped, going into a brief roll to show my belly.

‚ÄúI mean you no harm,‚Äù I said with every movement. ‚ÄúI am not your enemy. I mean you no harm.‚Äù

Unlike Colin, when the humans started making noises at me, it was just garbled nonsense. Their intent was clear, though.

They drew their weapons.

One of them had a long and pointy claw of metal, like what the Mandrills had carried. The other had a strange curvy stick that it held another stick crosswise to. More of the humans were responding to their garbled alarm sounds. Alone, I could easily kill one of them. And if the other was slow to retaliate, I could take it out as well. But killing wasn‚Äôt the way out of this. I had to convey peacefulness.

My body language wasn‚Äôt working. I needed to try and do what Colin would do. He was a human. They would understand his language.

The humans hadn‚Äôt attacked yet. Clearly, they were frightened of my obvious power, and waiting to outnumber me by enough that the fight would be even. That was fortunate for me. It gave me a second chance to make peace.

Just had to do it like a human.

Balancing on my hind legs was difficult. The humans‚Äô ability to do so didn‚Äôt make sense. But I had a tail to brace against the ground. Flailed my forelimbs at the humans, and tried to make sounds with my throat. It was just meaningless croaking.

They attacked.

The one with the curved stick did something, and the second stick flew through the air, striking the soft hide on my belly. There was a little metal tooth on the end of the stick that pierced through my skin.

It hurt.

For a brief moment, I wanted to retaliate. To rush them. Crush them.

But I remembered Colin‚Äôs warning. His condition.

Of course the humans attacked. Likely thought I was using my power against them. The wizard power that Colin had promised me to learn. In my haste to try and make peace, I‚Äôd scared them out of their minds. Foolish of me.

I fled, running back towards Colin. I hoped one would follow. If they saw him, they would help. But they were too focused. Single-minded on the defense of their camp. Admirable for them, but terrible for me.

‚ÄúColin,‚Äù I said when I returned, nudging him as hard as I could with my shoulder, trying to rouse him. ‚ÄúI cannot make contact. They attacked me. How do I make peace? How do I get help?‚Äù

*Stupid (directed at other, derogatory),* he grumbled. Where my hide touched his skin, he was warm. Too warm for even a warm-blooded being to be healthy. *Canine vocalization (loud, insistent) summons aid when Timothy (child, informal, nonspecific) is in the drinking water (dangerous, constructed), but my companion (friend, beloved) with higher INT (system) than me can‚Äôt even get a greeting (nonviolent, peaceful).*

He was clearly delirious. His eyes fluttered, but wouldn‚Äôt stay open. Looked pale. Too pale.

Time was running out.

I nudged my nose under his body. He was heavy, but under his care, I‚Äôd grown strong. Rolled him over my head and onto my back. Legs and arms dragged on either side of me, but it was the best I could do.

‚ÄúThey may hurt me,‚Äù I said as I started to carry Colin on my back towards the camp. ‚ÄúBut I must get you to them. They will help. They must help. Even if it means they attack me.‚Äù

It was slow to carry Colin like this. Slower than gripping with my mouth. Kept sliding around on my back, nearly falling one way or the other. Had to slow down or I‚Äôd drop him.

His body felt dangerously warm. His breathing was dangerously shallow. Didn‚Äôt have time to find a better way. Couldn‚Äôt drag him with my teeth, or the humans would attack before seeing something was wrong.

No time. No choices.

Just had to hope.

There were more humans at the edge of the camp when I got there again. Bolstered forces in hopes of facing me in a fair fight. I worried that they might attack again, flinging more of those tooth-tipped sticks at us.

Unexpectedly, their superior numbers worked to our advantage.

One of them saw me carrying Colin. It made some noises at the others as they were raising their weapons. As with the others, I couldn‚Äôt understand them at all. Just random human noises. But it stopped them. Stayed their hands.

The one who had spoken slowly approached. Its movements were cautious and hesitant, like terrified prey, but it approached. Looking at Colin, but casting fearful glances at my teeth.

It said something as it got close. Saw Colin‚Äôs condition.

Some of the others started to move forward, putting their weapons away. One of them ran into town, making a loud alarm-sound. Even without being able to understand the noises, I recognized bits of their body language from Colin‚Äôs past behavior.

Dismay. Concern. Worry.

Care.

The human approached, and carefully tried to scoop Colin off of my back. It was strong enough to lift him by itself. I let it take him.

It made a gesture that I‚Äôd seen from Colin before. A tip of the head. When Colin did that, his power let me understand that he wanted me to follow.

I followed the human into the camp as it took Colin in to help him.",RobertSKeene,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/13k4sgm/the_primeval_apocalypse_chapter_fiftynine/,collaboration,0.49119746685028076

Any advice/experiences with moving on after a clearance denial? 

Identity crisis: My goal since high school was to join NatSec/IC. I have 2 super-relevant degrees (finishing a master‚Äôs in an IC feeder school) and speak 2 critical languages. Current military. But I‚Äôm almost convinced I won‚Äôt be getting a clearance in the next decade.

How do I figure out what do do instead? My ‚Äòwhy‚Äô has been to serve our country as an analyst, linguist, or some sort of international affairs, regional or security SME. My whole college and mil career everyone told me I would be a perfect fit for three-letters given the pacing challenges we‚Äôre facing now. Looking at job openings, almost all of the above need a clearance to be anybody in this town. 

I thought that national security was my calling and never even thought about private business, tech, sales, marketing etc.

How do you reset your career after denial? How do you find meaning in something that has nothing to do with the ‚Äòmission‚Äô?

This one by u/jimpinhead caught me a little by surprise...I didn't realize just how close to this kind of scenario I had been when I was much younger, so it ended up a lot more relatable than anticipated! I wanted to put something innocent behind their exploration and experimentation; beneath all the gay denial tropes, I found there was a thread of candor and vulnerability that I could grab onto, finding myself cheering them on like ""Yes, shine on, my brave little burgeoning gay boys! Embrace your queer desires! The world is your bussy!"" There's also something very pure about a boy who clearly learned most of what he knows about sexuality from the internet, for better or worse. ü§£ Plus, at the risk of overanalyzing my smut, him being so sheltered that he has to learn about sex through porn gives us clear reason why it's so imperative for him to try to present as straight to his friends and family.

8088,2023-05-05 17:05:05-05:00,BBBY,TDA Response Regarding Their Denial To Accept BBBYQ Transfers,"For anyone following along, I made a post a day or two ago about TDA denying my request to allow some of my DRS shares to be transferred back into my TDA account.

For those who are interested as to my actions, I initiated a transfer for some of my DRS shares from AST to be transferred back to my original brokerage where those shares were bought, TD Ameritrade.

After filling out all the necessary paperwork and submitting my transfer request, I received a message back stating that TDA was denying my transfer request - in other words, they do not want my BBBYQ shares back in their brokerage for trading purposes. I requested additional information from them as to why my transfer was being denied, and they provided the following response (see attachment).

The sub attacked me on that previous post because I was moving shares out of DRS back to a brokerage, but considering AST has been down for weeks, and they charge a $0.12 cent commission per share, I thought it smart to test how quick I could move shares back to my brokerage if I needed. Well, it turns out, I can't move them back to my brokerage at all. TDA ain't accepting these moon tickets no more.

So, call this FUD, call me a shill, or whatever, I don't care. But for those of us who DRS'd assuming we could move shares back when we needed, you may want to contact your brokerage and ask if they are accepting these shares at all. TD Ameritrade is not. I plan on opening a Fidelity account to test that brokerage as well. I will update when I know more.

tldr: I DRS'd assuming I could easily transfer back to my brokerage any time I wanted, unfortunately, after testing my ability to transfer shares back to TD Ameritrade, I have been informed that they have ""opted"" to deny all transfer requests for BBBYQ.

Hello sweeties,

Happy weekend! I've been so excited to release this one, it's been such a long time since I've released some of my own Original Content over on reddit, so I really hope you enjoy it.

*""Be a good boy...and say, ""Please mommy, fuck my sissy hole""*

**Synopsis:** I am your dominant girlfriend and we have just finished dinner at your parent‚Äôs house for the first time. During the meal, I made you wear sexy pink lace panties, a pink chastity cage and a butt plug under your clothes. After dinner, we go to your old bedroom to sleep but I have other plans‚Ä¶ I want to fuck your boy pussy with the strap-on that I secretly brought in my purse. I start to peg you softly and tell you to not make a sound but I get carried away‚Ä¶‚Ä¶... I remind you that my parents will never know about the true you, the naughty things that you do with me. I always want you to call me mommy and I use that to tease, and play with you.....

8125,2023-04-30 13:30:05-05:00,cuckoldstories2,"She has her bull for sex, her cuck for everything else [denial][chastity]","My wife and I had been into cuckolding for a few years, and she really liked it. I could never get her wet, so sex with me was a painful chore. She would always make me wear condoms, and it was only after we were married she let me cum inside her a few times.

After a few years, I suggested we try cuckolding and she was apprehensive at first. But once she started getting messages from bulls, I could tell something had awakened in her. She got wet when we fooled around just talking about the bulls. She met up with some, and when she got home she would usually let me fuck her after they'd warmed her up and made her cum for me.

We both loved the idea of having a bull who could cum inside her though, and the pill was messing with her sex drive. So, my wife switched to an IUD and we went looking for a bull who wouldn't mind being completely exclusive to her, in exchange for being allowed to cum in her.

What I didn't realize is what a change it would make in her. Since creampies were part of the deal from the get go, he never once had to use a condom with her. Once he claimed her with his seed, he was very clear to me that I wouldn't be cumming inside her anymore, not that I had ever gotten many opportunities to. As the bull, her pussy belonged to him now and he decided if I could be allowed inside her. If I asked permission, he would let me fuck her on the condition I used a condom, and he was clear I cannot cum inside her even with a condom.

Now that she has been with him for three, going on four years, in that whole time only he has cum in her. He has cum inside her so much more than me it isn't even close, in a single month he probably unloads more of his seed into her than I ever got to. For the last year, I have been complete denied from sex with her, even with a condom. Instead I get a chastity cage while he gets to do whatever he wants with my wife's body.

He fulfills all sexual aspects of the relationship, and keeps my wife very satisfied. I've never seen her so happy and sexually awakened before. She is more confident and has become more dominant too. They both boss me around in the bedroom, and he ensures that I keep the house nice and clean for her, cook, and make her life as easy as possible. On a few times he has visited, and I cook for them while they get the master bedroom.

I never thought it would end up this way but I've accepted my role as a cuck completely and wish he will move in with us someday, to keep my wife fulfilled sexually and remind me every day who owns her pussy. I know that it is just for him to cum in and I'm lucky to get to clean it up when they are done.",ChasteWaste,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/cuckoldstories2/comments/133za6b/she_has_her_bull_for_sex_her_cuck_for_everything/,denial,0.4251032769680023

8187,2023-05-17 07:35:30-05:00,Femaleorgasmdenial,[19F] Anal Training and Denial Journal - Day 1,"Hello :P, this is my first of many journal entries to come.  I am currently being trained to stretch my ass by my Daddy u/cage_me_please.  Daddy has been training me since May 13th 2023 and we have made great progress as a Dom and Sub and been using the Obedience app to monitor my daily tasks, punishments and rewards.  Currently I can fit 5 fingers in my ass but not a full fist, my Daddy is aiming to greatly enhance my anal abilities.  Today Daddy suggested I should start recording a journal here on r/Femaleorgasmdenial on my training and keep everyone up to date.  The journals will be catergorised by different topics my Daddy wishes me to cover.

**Daily Tasks:**

Today on 17/05/2023 (Wednesday) I had 2 daily tasks from my Daddy.  The first one was to try to cum in 30 min from anal stimulation alone.  During my task I used both my fingers and a Lovense Edge 2 to achieve this.  At the end of the 30 minutes I was wet but sadly I failed to make myself cum today :(.

The second task was to change my phone home AND lockscreen to a photo of my Daddy's choosing and spend the day with it for the world to see, and for me to try and hide it shamefully.  I think one person so it on my train ride in the morning, however they didn't say anything which was a huge relief for me.  (If you'd like to see todays photo leave a comment :D)

**How Horny I felt today:**

I felt extremely horny during the evening hours of my day today, and fucked my currently sensitive pussy with two of my fingers for 2 minutes.  However, in doing do I shamefully broke me Daddy's 2nd rule ""You are to refrain from pleasuring yourself, except for what is permitted by Daddy.  Disobeying this rule will result in 2 Random Punishments"".  I will cover this more in the punishment topic of the journal.

**Rewards:**

Daddy gives me points to spend in a reward shop from completing my daily tasks.  However, those points can also be taken away for failing to complete tasks in time or for breaking certain rules.  Some of these rewards include:

* 1x Edge - Cost: 1Point
* 30 min of Porn - Cost: 2 Points
* Titty Play - Cost: 3 Points
* 5x Edge - Cost: 4 Points
* 1x Ruined Orgasm - Cost: 25 Points

Currently I have 5 points and am saving up for a Ruin hehe :3.

**Punishment Updates:**

As mentioned before I broke rule 2 on no pleasuring myself.  My Daddy has a bunch of punishments with a number and rolls a dice to decide which one I must be punished with.  This is my first time being punished by my Daddy and I couldn't be more ashamed of breaking my Daddy's trust in me and disobeying him.  The two punishments for me were:

1. No. 1 Salivation

* You are to refrain from consuming any sugary foods or drinks for 7 days.  Note that this includes non-dessert options; many common beverages such as lemonade and Dr. Pepper have enough sugar to land them on the banned list for this punishment, as do certain alcoholic beverages.

2.   No. 7 Humiliation

* For the next 7 days, you are to write the following on your body:

1. ""Anal Whore"" on your ass.
2. ""Wrong Hole"" above your pussy.
3. ""Denial Slut"" on your stomach.
4. ""Daddy's Property"" high up on your inner thigh.
5. A tally of the number of days since your last orgasm on your wrist.  This must be left visible for the casual observer. (Currently 3 days but 4 tomorrow)

**How I'm enjoying my training:**

I'm enjoying my train quite thoroughly!!!  It's amazing to be trained by u/cage_me_please they're an amazing Dom!!!  This is my first time being anal trained and I am loving every moment with my Daddy!!!! :D

‚ÄúThe police take all security threats seriously, and will investigate persons who intentionally cause public alarm,‚Äù they told The Straits Times, adding that they are investigating this as a case of communicating false information of something harmful.

Shin Min Daily News reported the incident on Sunday, citing a food delivery worker who had noticed police on the scene when he was picking up an order from the outlet on Thursday.The man, who gave his name as Mr Zhuo, 40, said the officers appeared to be looking for something.

He added that customers were not allowed to dine at the outlet and could order only takeaways. McDonald‚Äôs employees were tight-lipped when he asked them what happened.

For communicating false information about a bomb threat, an offender can receive a jail term of up to seven years, a fine of up to $50,000, or both.

8430,2023-02-23 04:31:06-06:00,skeptic,Is somebody pulling an elaborate hoax on Eric Weinstein and Sam Harris,"Two years ago, Sam Harris released three independent statements on three different podcasts saying that he had been contacted by somebody high up in the government, saying that they're going to be making an important disclosure about UFOs soon and they want him to help with messaging about technology that will potentially change the world.

They promised that soon he would be on a Zoom call with ""*former heads of the CIA and Office of Naval Research and people whose bona fide are very easy to track*""

You can find transcriptions of those statements by Harris [here](https://medium.com/on-the-trail-of-the-saucers/what-say-you-sam-harris-who-called-you-details-please-3cebb3d7baa1).

Recently Eric Weinstein was on Joe Rogan saying the [exact same thing](https://twitter.com/thebadstats/status/1628572086875869186) (short clip) - Sam Harris and I have both been contacted by somebody saying that there is a major disclosure planned and they need him to communicate this news to the world.

Weinstein claims they haven't told him what it is yet because he doesn't have clearance but they have promised to fly him out to Colorado Springs to show him something that will blow his mind. 

This started two years ago and he has been waiting for that promised flight ever since.

He then seems to suggest that he's still in regular contact with them and they keep making excuses for why this isn't the right time yet ü§£

Eric then claims that this has been going on for **!!three!!** years.

To the best of my knowledge Sam Harris hasn't mentioned it since those three clips from two years ago.

Maybe Harris has now realised that it's a hoax but Eric is still very hopeful?

Either way it's incredible to me that two people who attract millions of followers for their intellectual insights could be so easily taken in.

This is why critical thinking is important - just because you're intelligent, that doesn't mean you know how to filter likely claims from unlikely claims.

For bonus content, have fun with the other whacky claims Eric made on Joe Rogan's podcast - there is a lot of it:

I commonly see people tout these dumb statistics, especially the washington post where it says that ""there have been more mass shootings than days in 2023"". What bothers me is that if you use there metric, ""mass"" shooting happen many times a day, but that's mostly gang violence/domestic violence and other shootings not associated with the actual term. 

Mother Jones' database only recorded 6 for this year (source: https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/) 

In this modern information age, no one checks sources or questions what anyone says. It's a blatant lie when these politicians say these things. Is it political grandstanding to deepen the ties within their base toward these candidates? Like what the hell is this? No one really wants to solve the problems. If you go to NYC in the 90's, by these politicians definitions there would've been way more ""mass"" shootings than there are today. They still have the strictest gun laws in the 5 boroughs and if you go by their definitions, there are ""mass"" shootings multiple times a week. I just don't get it at all. What can we do about this? 

All this does is disregard the mentally ill people and anti-social behavior in favor of just doing a simple and ineffective solution (gun control) that is a disservice to society at large, and most refuse to do and say anything about it. 

These lies are hurting the general public whether they advocate for gun control or not - by disarming them, and detracting from the actual problems causing these folks to lose their shit. What can we do? When there is no independent media, and all the facts become distorted, when can the truth actually be heard, and real solutions be put in place?

Had planned for a long time to take Lake ashore limited from Buffalo to Boston before traveling back home to Maine. When checking in at Buffalo station earlier this week, the ticket agent told us that bicycles weren‚Äôt allowed from Albany to Boston. There was nothing about no bicycles online for this stretch. In fact, there are multiple places online that state that bicycles are allowed on the Lake Shore Limited.

We were 1000% screwed. As a result, we had to take a last minute train to NYC and then take the NEC to Boston arriving well after midnight‚Ä¶all for $450 more. Additionally, all transport to Maine was gone at that point. South Station was closed, so the option was to either wander the streets of Boston all night or spent another few hundred dollars on last minute hotel room. We decided for the latter. Misinformation online caused us almost $1000 of additional costs.

Is there anything we can do? We are both grad students and have little money. This was extremely unexpected and we didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. Every employee that we talked to has been soulless or has no answers. I spent 3 hours on the phone and all they offered was a $100 voucher. I feel like we should get a refund.

So, this post blew my monocle out of my eye socket: ""Illegal Naked Shorting is Happening in Front of Our Eyes - I Got Banned From Stocktwits For Showing The Truth - They NEED YOUR SHARES!"" Pretty intense, right?  


[https://www.reddit.com/r/ATERstock/comments/13n4kho/illegal\_naked\_shorting\_is\_happening\_in\_front\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ATERstock/comments/13n4kho/illegal_naked_shorting_is_happening_in_front_of/)

&amp;#x200B;

This post is a veritable rollercoaster of claims about Regulation SHO, naked short selling, and our good friends, the market makers. While the author's burning passion could rival the heat of a thousand suns, it's riddled with some misunderstandings about the inner gears and cogs of our beloved stock market. And we all know that misinformation can sow confusion, or worse, fear among investors, especially those still getting their feet wet.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I thought it was high time we got down to brass tacks and do a little detective work. Trust me, I'm not here to throw the author under the bus, but to clear the swamp of misconceptions and keep our GATER pool crystal clear from misleading info. Let's put on our thinking caps and debunk these wild claims

&amp;#x200B;

The main claim:

&amp;#x200B;

**""The flat bar all day was because we got put on the Reg SHO, which is a rule to help stop ILLEGAL NAKED SHORTING.""**  The author‚Äôs view of Reg SHO is about as clear as mud. Let‚Äôs get some things straight.

&amp;#x200B;

Reg SHO isn‚Äôt just a single rule, it's a family of rules established by the SEC aimed at preventing abusive short selling and enhancing overall market transparency. It‚Äôs not just about curbing illegal naked shorting.

&amp;#x200B;

Think of it more like a guard dog rather than a silver bullet against illegal activities.Saying that a 'flat bar' on the stock chart is a direct offspring of Reg SHO is oversimplifying things like calling an alligator just a big lizard. Stock prices bob and weave based on a multitude of factors: supply and demand dynamics, market sentiment, economic indicators, you name it. Reg SHO can't puppeteer stock prices into a 'flat bar.'

&amp;#x200B;

The author seems to jumble Rule 201 (the ""short sale circuit breaker"") and Rule 203 under Reg SHO. Rule 201 kicks in when a stock's price plummets by 10% or more from the previous day's closing price, irrespective of why the price fell. It's a safety net to halt a stock's price from tumbling due to aggressive short selling.

&amp;#x200B;

Crucially, Rule 201 triggering is a routine event and doesn't suggest illegal naked shorting.And then we have the author's ""confirmation"" that ATER made it to the mysterious ""Circuit Breaker List"" - which he claims validates his thesis. Well...Let's glance at the ""Circuit Breaker Lists"" from previous days, which conveniently was ignored:

ATER made a guest appearance on the Short Sell Circuit Breaker list numerous times in recent days. So, claiming that making the list is an indication of illegal activity is like saying an alligator with a full belly is proof of a crime scene. This circuit breaker trips every time a stock falls 10% for any reason - which seems to be a hobby for ATER lately.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. **""The Reg SHO rule 'stops short selling on a security when prices have decreased by 10% or more during the trading day, mandating that new bids be above the current price.' - Meaning they literally couldn't push the price below $0.56.""**  
Let's reel this one in, shall we? The author appears to have tangled up the Alternative Uptick Rule (Rule 201) in his net. It gets triggered when a stock price falls 10% or more from the previous day's closing price. It doesn't mean the price can't sink lower than $0.56 or whatever magic number we're tossing around. It means short selling is only allowed if the price is above the current national best bid.
2. **""Over 75% of shares went through the dark pools today to stop buy orders hitting the lit exchange and keep it shorted down to the maximum possible levels...""**  
This isn't necessarily the case. Dark pools were made to facilitate trading large amounts of securities without moving the market price too much. Saying that 75% of shares going through dark pools is proof of illegal or unethical activity is like blaming every fish that goes into a gator's mouth on gator conspiracy.
3. **""I don't want to come off as a conspiracy nut, but this thing runs deeper than any of us know...""**  
Sounds like we're diving into a swamp conspiracy, doesn't it? Market manipulation happens, we all know that. But insinuating a broad conspiracy without tangible proof is like claiming the Loch Ness Monster is hiding in your backyard pool.
4. **""They didn't want any of the buys going onto the lit exchange, they wanted to keep it shorted to the max level possible to scare you into selling your shares cheap and cover their asses...""**  
Here the author's casting some shadowy figures with sinister intentions, without any actual evidence. Market prices can and do fluctuate due to a bunch of legitimate factors, not just the schemes of cloaked figures in a backroom.
5. **""That chart on Friday is NOT NORMAL...""**  
Ah, the subjective nature of 'normal.' It's worth noting that price charts are simply the footprints of the market participants' buying and selling decisions. Stamping a chart as 'not normal' is like declaring a particularly wavy swamp as a sign of impending alligator uprising.
6. **The 'Short Sale Circuit Breaker'**  
is presented as the smoking gun for illegal naked short selling. However, the reality is a tad more complicated. This rule can be triggered by a significant price drop for a myriad of reasons, not just due to illegal naked short selling.
7. **""If the large price drop is NOT primarily caused by short sellers, the circuit breaker will NOT dampen further price declines"" - That is basically imo proof that the drop and flatline was caused by naked short sellers...""**  
This, my friends, is a wild leap in logic. The circuit breaker triggering only indicates that the stock's price fell 10% or more, prompting short sale restrictions. It's not an immediate stamp of guilt on the forehead of illegal short sellers.

  


So, there you have it,  It's always good to remind ourselves that the stock market isn't some mysterious creature lurking in the depths. It's a dynamic and complex ecosystem, just like our beloved swamps, that we navigate with knowledge, common sense, and an eye for detail. Let's keep our waters clean from misconceptions and misinformation and keep on doing what we do best. It's already apocalyptical for most of us in this ticker for 2 years+, no need to hype any positive nor negative magical scenarios, pulled out of bumholes.

My midwives were shocked when I said I have PCOS...,"Went for my first face-to-face midwife appointment today at 16w + 5. When my midwife asked me about my history, I began talking about PMS but clarified it's only been a recent thing as I've just started having regular periods in the past 2 years. She looked dumbfounded and asked why. I explained that I have PCOS and was previously unmedicated, therefore wasn't ovulating. She was absolutely shocked and looked at her colleague as if I was a miracle case. They couldn't believe it.

I didn't realise how many people (medical professionals even) hear the term ""PCOS"" and immediately associate it with complete infertility. From my experience, there are many ways in which we can have a health menstrual cycle, therefore become pregnant. Whether that's through medication or a lifestyle change. Was anybody told otherwise? My GP NEVER told me I was infertile. In fact, she reassured me that she had PCOS and had three healthy pregnancies, but she reminded me that without treatment, it may be difficult to become pregnant. At the time of my diagnosis 8 years ago, I didn't start any treatment plan as I wasn't thinking about starting a family at that time.

After being with my boyfriend, I knew I wanted kids with him right away. While we weren't accurately TTC, we kind of had a ""if it happens, it happens"" attitude. It happened maybe the third or fourth time we decide to have unprotected sex. This was after maybe two years taking Metformin.

The main point of this post is that I think sooo many people just assume a woman with PCOS is automatically infertile, which is kind of worrying misinformation when I see so many posts on here from people who are devestated by their recent diagnosis.

Had planned for a long time to take Lake ashore limited from Buffalo to Boston before traveling back home to Maine. When checking in at Buffalo station earlier this week, the ticket agent told us that bicycles weren‚Äôt allowed from Albany to Boston. There was nothing about no bicycles online for this stretch. In fact, there are multiple places online that state that bicycles are allowed on the Lake Shore Limited.

We were 1000% screwed. As a result, we had to take a last minute train to NYC and then take the NEC to Boston arriving well after midnight‚Ä¶all for $450 more. Additionally, all transport to Maine was gone at that point. South Station was closed, so the option was to either wander the streets of Boston all night or spent another few hundred dollars on last minute hotel room. We decided for the latter. Misinformation online caused us almost $1000 of additional costs.

Is there anything we can do? We are both grad students and have little money. This was extremely unexpected and we didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. Every employee that we talked to has been soulless or has no answers. I spent 3 hours on the phone and all they offered was a $100 voucher. I feel like we should get a refund.

The message of the video is very puzzling, as ""PSSD"" is depression, and vortioxetine (a drug Clayton lobbies for) doesn't cause any sexual issues while on the drugs according to her, which is very false.

*""The most common side effects reported with vortioxetine are nausea, vomiting, constipation, and sexual dysfunction, among others.""*

Wikipedia even documents with detailed information this drug performs much worse than placebo.  Oh dear. Check for yourself:

I think this is a good example of pharma deep, multi layered modus operandi.

They fund studies with falsified information.

They fund corrupt strategic high ranks in academia:

Wilson Professor of Psychiatry and Neurobehavioral Sciences in the Department of Psychiatry and Neurobehavioral Sciences at the University of Virginia School of Medicine.\[1\]\[2\] From 2005 to 2007, she was the President of the International Society for the Study of Women‚Äôs Sexual Health (ISSWSH).\[3\]*

They infiltrate medical organizations like ISSM

There you can see Anita is on the committee in charge of managing the conflicts of interests. So the fox is guarding the chicken coop. Sad.

*The mission of the committee is to manage the society‚Äôs conflict of interest policy and oversees the review of disclosures for potential conflicts of interest.*

And they end with pharmaceutical marketing like this video telling blatant lies, as at this point the damage these substances cause is very well known and even legislated. As these drugs have black label warnings in USA, and EMA warnings on Europe (after a lot of good lobbying by PSSD pioneer medic David Healy), and equivalent warnings on other countries like UK, Canada, Hong Kong, etc.

Like the now sadly famous 1990s Purdue Pharma OxyContin advertising, that sells the drug as a miracle drug, and those who took it ended very damaged, addicted and many, sadly, dead.

Despite the wealth of information and data available online, it seems that a lack of media literacy of the average American; the prevalence and speed of which misinformation and disinformation spreads on social media; and media bubbles caused by the practices of these social media companies has led to people becoming more misinformed and politically divided in the U.S. This has been exploited by rival countries such as Russia and China, who have engaged in online operations to spread disinformation on both sides of the politician aisle with the intent of causing political strife and weakening the foundations on our society.

This is a strategy that seems to be working for them. In the past years, we‚Äôve seen the Capital insurrection spurred by misinformation/disinformation surrounding the 2020 election; the rise of QANON and other conspiracy theories online; a rise in far-right extremism bred by online echo chambers. Disinformation and misinformation also directly contributed to people not taking COVID-19 seriously or outright rejecting its existence, delaying a coordinated response and causing mistrust of the vaccine. 

Is this a problem that can be fixed? If the average American can not distinguish what is true or not online and outright rejects any information that goes against their confirmation bias, how can this gap be bridged? Do social media companies need to be held liable for the spread of misinformation or disinformation on their platforms?

They are victims of a tidal wave of misinformation.","Many leftists seem to have it stuck in their heads that because they participated in strikebreaking that makes them the scum of the Earth. This view is entirely wrong. Here's a little history on the organization that often gets ignored:

The Pinkerton Agency was founded in 1850 by the staunch progressive and abolitionist Allan Pinkerton, and the attorney Edward Rucker. There's not much information on their first few years in operation, but by 1861, they were tasked with escorting the new president, Abraham Lincoln, to Washington DC. 

Their success in this endeavor would prove valuable upon the start of the civil war, leading to Pinkerton himself becoming part of the intelligence division of the war department, which spied on the Confederacy throughout the war.  

Fast-forwards to 1871, in the middle of reconstruction. The Federal Government is stretched thin trying to enforce it's law in the Southern states, so what do they do? That's right you guessed it, they contract the Pinkertons to go after Confederate guerillas and investigate the corrupt Southern law enforcement that were enabling them.

After this point is when they start to get really involved (or at least they're far more prominent) in strikebreaking, the most notable and infamous instance being the Homestead strike.

In that case, the Pinkertons were hired to peacefully escort workers to replace the ones that were striking, and who had just recently seized the factory. As they got closer on their barges, however, violent mobs of strikers (angry that they were being replaced) started firing at them, trying to prevent them from making it to shore. After landing, a firefight broke out. It's unclear who fired the first shot, but at least one person testified that 3 Pinkerton agents were dead before they started firing back. In the ensuing conflict many people died or were injured, and the Pinkertons attempted to surrender multiple times. When their surrender was eventually accepted, they were beaten and stoned by the strikers, but eventually were allowed to leave by the sheriff. 

After a number of other instances like this, congress banned the federal government from contracting with any private detective agency in 1893. After that, the group would become far less prominent, until they eventually morphed into the modern group we know today. They haven't done much that's relevant since the 1930's except for taking some guy's magic cards so I'll just skip over their modern history. 

Understanding these historical facts, it is undeniable that the Pinkertons, at least during the 19th century, while not very pro-union, did a lot to improve the wellbeing of workers, with their principal opponents being white supremacists, violent criminals that harmed peaceful workers, and corrupt government officials. You should be supporting them.",0WatcherintheWater0,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/VaushV/comments/13ojlfu/the_pinkertons_were_heroes_of_the_oppressed_and/,misinformation,0.40818607807159424

Harper: ""I think you're pulling a righty out of the bullpen and telling Scott Foster-- okay Scotty do what you need to do"".

I know Zach is being somewhat tongue in cheek. But everything wrong with the NBA is encapsulated in this convo. Lakers exceptionalism? Check. Arguing that small markets succeeding is bad for the NBA? Check. The grossest part is Harper including himself and the Athletic in his collective ""as an NBA"". 

It's absurd that the league hasn't figured out how to nurture small market franchises. It's absurd that the NBA has chosen against marketing a generational talent and x2 MVP in Jokic. And it's absurd that I'm emotionally preparing myself for the refs to swing a pivotal game in the Lakers / Nuggets series while listening to a podcast from a company that supposedly prides itself on high quality journalism openly advocate for such a scenario. 

It's almost like they don't realize that the over-reliance on big markets for ratings is a direct result of many NBA cities viewing the league as a glorified WWE specifically because of the Stern era and discourse like this.

However, it is essential to separate facts from speculation when discussing this topic.

George Soros is a billionaire philanthropist who has donated to various causes through his Open Society Foundations. One of his key areas of focus is criminal justice reform, which includes supporting progressive candidates for district attorney positions. Soros believes that the criminal justice system in the United States is in need of significant change, and he sees the role of district attorneys as pivotal in implementing such reforms.

Soros has contributed millions of dollars to political action committees (PACs) and other organizations that support progressive district attorney candidates across the United States. These contributions are made within the bounds of the law and are publicly disclosed. By financially supporting these candidates, Soros hopes to contribute to the broader movement for criminal justice reform.

It is essential to recognize that supporting political candidates is not an inherently nefarious activity. Wealthy individuals and organizations have been funding political campaigns for as long as such campaigns have existed. In this case, Soros's contributions are intended to advance specific policy goals related to criminal justice reform, which he believes will benefit society as a whole.

Going into mid-November, it was common knowledge at that point that barring a big upset, Michigan and Ohio State would face off against each other as 11-0 teams vying for the Big Ten East title.

Michigan was expected to blow out Illinois, but the contest was much closer than expected, even though they were playing in Ann Arbor in the Big House and not Champaign at Memorial Stadium. Illinois led 17-10 in the 4th quarter, but Michigan won 19-17 thanks to a field goal at the end. Michigan was saved by the refs. For example, on 2nd &amp; 10, J.J. McCarthy threw a pass to Cornelius Johnson for a five-yard gain. Despite the fact that the ball touched the ground, officials ruled it a catch. Michigan also got away a pick play before that. 

I think the refs were wearing wires and were being instructed by the Big Ten to rig the game in favor of Michigan at the last minute because nobody expected Illinois to play Michigan as close as they did, and the Big Ten wanted to keep their 11-0 vs. 11-0 matchup between Michigan and Ohio State for TV ratings.",chi-fong-ku,670,https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/12r8h18/what_are_some_cfb_conspiracies_you_have_from_the/,conspiracy,0.45424312353134155

8939,2023-05-06 15:06:28-05:00,CPTSDNextSteps,Therapeutic Harm Reduction Suggestions - How your therapist should treat you and how to mitigate iatrogenic harm.," 

I wrote this list of suggestions for my future therapist after having several bad experiences with previous therapists. It started as a personalized list of how I wanted to be treated. These suggestions create safety to do deep trauma recovery work.

* Listen first
* Ask me what I want to talk about
* Validate me first 
* I am the expert on my personal experience and how I choose to analyze it. Validate and hold space first, then offer resources.
* It‚Äôs okay to not have answers. Witness, hold space. Connect to self. Self-leadership is a goal. (IFS terminology).
* Pay attention to my physical expression and nervous system regulation. (Yawns, eye contact, seated position, hand placement, deep breaths, etc.) If I stop looking at you and withdraw, check in with me and what I'm experiencing. (Learn more by looking in to Polyvagal Theory and Somatic work)
* If I show a hint of aggression towards you, default to curiosity and apologize first, then explore our misunderstanding second. An apology doesn‚Äôt mean that you are universally wrong, it just means that you want to create safety in the relationship. That you value the message held by exiles and protectors. (IFS terminology)
* If I say, ‚ÄúWhen you do this, it hurts me.‚Äù Don‚Äôt deny it happened or that it‚Äôs nothing. Even if you don‚Äôt have a memory of doing it, or you think I‚Äôm misinterpreting what happened, still apologize that it happened and say that it wasn‚Äôt your intention and that you‚Äôll be willing to pay attention in the future.
* CBT often results in gaslighting pain. Don't ever challenge me as if you‚Äôre providing tough love. Witnessing is more important. ""It feels like that sometimes."" ""That sounds like a heavy burden."" ""I don't fully understand but I'm curious."" These are all better responses than denying my interpretation of my trauma. Ask what solutions I see and help me brainstorm options. Present ideas as suggestions.
* I usually don‚Äôt like to interrupt people but I‚Äôm learning that I should interrupt when something doesn‚Äôt feel right. Please don‚Äôt take it personal. I will let you know when I feel myself having a negative experience.
* Please feel comfortable expressing your boundaries. I indirectly benefit when you take care of yourself.

Laurence Heller said, ‚ÄúA healthy child protests when they are mistreated.‚Äù In this case, a healthy client communicates when they are having a hard time. If a therapist doesn‚Äôt attune to you, consider it a red flag. A therapist can‚Äôt provide care to you, that they do not provide to themselves. If they can‚Äôt hold space for their own pain, they are less likely to hold space for yours.

One discerning question to ask yourself: Is this pain coming from inside or outside? Am I in pain because my therapist is doing something harmful to me? Or is this pain that is on it‚Äôs way out? Pain that is on it‚Äôs way out feels good because it‚Äôs being witnessed. Pain that is compounding or retraumatizing does not feel better after the distress has passed. You might feel even more sensitive afterwards and willing to fight someone or dissociate. 

Something you can say when your therapist is saying something that hurts. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you're right in some way but this isn‚Äôt landing well for me. I‚Äôd like to work at this from a different angle or try again on a different day.‚Äù You could also say, ‚ÄúI am feeling a protector/anger/dissociation coming up. I think we need to pay attention to that right now.‚Äù 

For ideal trauma recovery, safety is created first before big moves are made. If you do not feel safe and comfortable, and your therapist is trying to make some moves (ex. challenge you), let them know your protectors do not feel secure enough to let things move. Trying to force change and bypass protectors can have negative results, or at minimum create distrust in your psyche.  

One might argue this list is too coddling or self centered. Therapy is about changing the self so it should be self centered. It creates safety to correct ourselves authentically. If it doesn't happen organically from the center of one's consciousness it could potentially reinforce deeply held harmful beliefs such as ""I can't trust myself. I'm inherently broken, and need my savior therapist to fix me."" We don't need tough love. Reality is tough enough.

A statement like, ""You're exhibiting classic signs of codependency. Would you like to explore the research together?"" Is helpful. Letting a client know something they did is abusive is helpful, because they can know the times it happened to them was wrong. There are exceptions and limitations to these suggestions but in general these strategies cultivate self sovereignty and should reduce harm when working with a therapist.",SLCPermaculture,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSDNextSteps/comments/13a0kt3/therapeutic_harm_reduction_suggestions_how_your/,mitigate,0.49209314584732056

9000,2023-04-17 12:48:23-05:00,relationship_advice,My (30F) bf (34M) uses coke to mitigate ADHD symtomps. It works. I'm terrified.," My bf of one year and a half frequently uses cocaine to mend his adhd symptoms.

I should state that we have used it recreationally, like a long night out or concert, together. And I don't mind doing that here and there. But lately, the last few months he has been using it to treat his symptoms. He was recently prescribed Adderall but our local pharmacies are out -- doctor also prescribed consorta due to the shortage, yet the pharmacies near him don't have that either. So we're waiting to hopefully get it soon.

I've voiced my concerns about him doing it so frequently. Just last week I told him I don't trust his boundaries with the drug (I've seen adverse affects on him in the past, since it's so highly addictive).

The sad part is... I like who he becomes when he's on it. He's attentive, calm, gets things done, proactive. But I'm sad because of obvious reasons- it's a potent addictve drug, has negative affects on overall health. When I spoke to him last week he apologized and said I was right. I want him to deal with his symptoms in healthy ways. Like exercise, eating right, establishing a schedule, etc.

I'm also incredibly irked at his roommate. His roommate buys coke, whenever it's in the house it's typically because of him. He thinks it's not an issue to use it, but he also has better boundaries with the drug than my bf. I caught them doing it last night. My bf is an adult responsible for his decisions, but it doesn't help to have a 'friend' like his roommate. My bf slept on the couch after I forwarded him an apologetic text message he sent me just last week when I was, again, upset with him for coke use. I worry that these are the behaviors of an addict, and I don't know what to say or how to help him. I'm seeking advice on how to help him, or what sort of boundaries to try to put in place.

TL;DR! I've spoken to my bf multiple times about his cocaine use scares me about our future together. He uses it as an easy-to-get way of managing adhd. It does help. But it's not worth the overall health effects. How can I support him?",Ok_Resolution_4059,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/12pqizb/my_30f_bf_34m_uses_coke_to_mitigate_adhd_symtomps/,mitigate,0.44241276383399963

1. Contant disconnect with the networking.

By ""network"" I mean the system that lets Flechs to connect multiple users together via the three-words. This is not great as having to undo this might impact our power use. Maybe? If it is not that, what is causing this? We kept reconnecting but it was annoying. 

2. At one point one of my sheets messed up. It would not respond, though the other two sheets would. It also lost all the markings so when we transferred to old-fashioned paper I had to just guess what damage and spent ammo. I have no idea what happened. I could not find a way to recover it. 

3. There is no 3.

9142,2023-03-15 08:15:54-05:00,ChronicIllness,How WFH helps to mitigate my chronic illnesses - I have come off SSDI for fulltime employment,"I see a lot of posts about working and chronic illness. I thought I would share how I personally mitigate my illnesses and have continued to move up in my career. 

Some back story is that I was on disability for a long time, but even still I was either in school or I had a part time job. I have now been working fulltime since Jan 2022 and it has been a major transition from being on SSDI. I had a job for 7 months that required going into the office 5 days a week and it was so incredibly difficult, but now I WFH since Aug 2022.

Things I have been diagnosed with, the struggle they caused, and how I mitigate them while working from home :

* Chronic Fatigue made getting out of bed and ready for the office a struggle. I now choose my own start time every day. I can begin work anytime between 7am - 10am so on days where I am super fatigued, I can sleep in a little. 
* A minor Traumatic Brain Injury from years prior has led to memory issues as well as a moderate-severe attention deficit. In the office I would get increasingly restless as the day went on and would even leave early sometimes as I found applying myself towards something for 8 hours straight almost impossible. WFH I am not tracked by my employer so if I am struggling with focus and concentration, I get up and take a break to try and refresh my mind. 
* C-PTSD causes flashbacks infrequently now but does still influence my overall emotional wellbeing. When in the office I would get a flood of emotions out of nowhere while sitting at my desk, and admittedly I would break down crying silently in my cubicle. I now ""set the mood"" in my home office with warm lighting, upbeat music, an oil diffuser and snacks / water. I also am visited in my office by my four pets and my partner when he's home, so in that way I have company and am not isolated in a cubicle.
* Muscular skeletal issues in my feet and spine caused me a lot of pain when walking around and sitting at my desk. I now utilize multiple heating pads if necessary to minimize pain. (I feel like if I brought in multiple heating pads to the office I would get looks.) For my job I do not have to be on camera so this is not an issue.
* IBS led me to visit the restroom often and for a longer amount of time than some others. WFH I just go down the hall and do not receive any glances from coworkers. Saves embarrassment.
* Unilateral Inner Ear Dysfunction (newly diagnosed in 2023) led me to have violent episodes of vertigo causing me to be unbalanced. I did take a two-month break from work (and driving etc) to recover. Now that I am back, I find that using a filter for the blue light on my three monitors while being gentle with my head movements has worked for me. I have not been feeling anymore dizzy than my baseline while working.

I currently work in the data and tech field where salaries are high. If you can find an employer that is understanding of chronic illness, even bigger score. I fully recommend working from home!

Of course, it will not get anywhere close to fixing the underlying cause (whatever that ends up being), but I believe it may definitely help to at least partly reduce symptoms on a day-to-day basis. Amphetamine is able to increase sensitivity of your sex organs, massively increase libido, and provide some serious dopamine - which I assume could help with the dementia-esque/brain fog symptoms of PSSD.

Yes, the average guy didn‚Äôt have to ‚Äúself improve‚Äù decades ago, but that was because women were more reliant on men. in the mid-late 1900s, They relied on them for retirement, for getting a credit card, for basic needs being met, and all in all their entire livelihoods were defined by getting married and supporting their man out of HS. Now, women don‚Äôt NEED a man. they have to WANT you. 

Due to that, men have to be better than who they were decades ago in some areas in order to find a quality woman to be with. What that means may be different for all women though. 

And since the modern woman is one that is much more independent, and doesn‚Äôt need a man, then the modern man will have to adapt to that instead of trying to revert women back to traditionalism. For some guys, it may mean learning how to be more in tune with your own emotions, maybe it‚Äôs losing/gaining weight, maybe it‚Äôs learning to socialize and bettering your humor.

9259,2023-05-10 12:19:27-05:00,Dimension20,Best season to adapt into an animated series?,"With the continued success of Vox Machina and the development of an Adventure Zone series at Peacock (yet to be picked up but fingers crossed) I feel that Dimension 20 is positioned to be the next hit dungeons and dragons podcast that gets its own animated streaming show.

All that being said, what do we think would be the best season to adapt? I think we can rule out all the sidequests, i think lots would make great animated series but I imagine there would be a desire to go for the big one's first.

Here are my arguments for why each has potential:

Fantasy high - Highschool as a setting is immediately easy to connect with for most new viewers, 4 seasons of material when you include the sidequests, slight edge in terms of how hard it would be to animate compared to other seasons. 

Unsleeping City - Easiest setting for a new audience to connect with because new york is maybe the most recognizable city on earth and all the magic stuff has its own clear in world explination (you don't need to know what the classes or races are like in FH), 2 seasons worth of content, both seasons stories are deeply poignant to the current moment.

Crown of Candy - The contrast of setting and story would be heightened by constantly having it visualized, the story is really clean and strong, there is a game of thrones itch that isn't fully being scratched (I know House of the Dragon is successful but if anything I would argue Succession is the only show successfully capturing the politics and tension of early GoT).

Starstruck Odyssey - Lends itself extremely well to animation becuase of the diversity in settings and characters, preexisting setting (some of which is a graphic novel) so lots of visuals and ideas to work off of in creating the season and as content for additional seasons, it's the season that works best episodically.

Neverafter - Characters and general concept that a general audience knows well, horror works really well in animation, season that feels it has the most ""left on the table/areas to explore"" to expand upon if future seasons were wanted.

A few differences to the r-cc Karma Multipliers are

* allowed to transfer/sell 35% of Bricks compared with r-cc 25% of moons earned
* Minimum KM is 0.20 instead of r-ccs 0.10

Although currently Bricks are only worth $0.016 a big difference from moons at $0.18 perhaps implementing this rule will slow off the constant sell pressure.

Crypto market corrections can be a rollercoaster ride for investors, but they also provide an opportunity to HODL, learn, and adapt your approach to investing. Here are some tips for making the most out of market corrections:

1. Set your moon targets and diversify your bags: Before investing, set clear goals and a time horizon for achieving them. Diversify your portfolio across a range of assets, such as cryptocurrencies, stablecoin yields, synthetic assets, equities, and commodities, to manage risk and reduce the impact of market volatility.

2. Don't be afraid to cut losses and FUD: While it's important to avoid panic selling, recognizing when an investment is no longer performing as expected and cutting your losses can help reduce further losses. Use news as a way to inform your opinion on an investment, not to FOMO into a decision.

3. Seek out FUD and DYOR: Avoid confirmation bias by seeking out criticism of an investment before buying. Don't become emotionally attached to your investments, and take the time to DYOR (Do Your Own Research) before making decisions.

4. If you've made mistakes, recognize them, take a break, talk to your crypto fam, and evaluate your sources of information, risk tolerance, and skill: Acknowledge when you've made a mistake and take a break from monitoring the markets. Talk to your crypto fam to get a fresh perspective on your investment decisions. Evaluate the sources of information you rely on and adjust your approach if necessary.

5. Stay focused on your moon targets and adapt your approach as needed: Investing is a personal decision, and there's no one-size-fits-all approach. Stay focused on your moon targets and be willing to adapt your approach as needed.

By HODLing, learning from your mistakes, and adapting your approach to market corrections, you can stay focused on your moon targets and achieve success in the crypto markets. Remember to DYOR and make decisions that align with your objectives and risk tolerance. To the moon!

9353,2023-05-17 10:34:42-05:00,DMAcademy,How do I properly incorporate or adapt to an obtuse backstory?,"Hello fellow DMs

I‚Äôve been DMing a homebrew game for a little over 2.5 years now and a few months ago we lost a PC. Was a dangerous combat and they frontlines just a bit too close to the sun(it was a dragon). So RIP Crow the Cleric.

What happened next was that player rolled up a next PC and backstory and we moved forward. I read over the backstory the first time they sent it. But we were in the middle of an arch very unrelated to that PC and their backstory. Now a few months have gone by and I‚Äôm in a place to start giving this PC the spotlight a bit more for this arch. 

Only issue I‚Äôm coming into is how obtuse this backstory is from an ‚Äúimplications‚Äù standpoint. What I mean is that much of their backstory focuses on ties to an ancient civilization that I‚Äôve never really been invested in. And attempt to tie in and explain lore for my BBEG. 

For context our BBEG is an ancient eldritch god long forgotten by the modern world. And much of this new PCs backstory revolves around explaining the BBEG and an ancient civilization that worshiped them(?) 

I‚Äôve kept a lot of the info about the BBEG secret so far, trying to keep the allure of an ancient forgotten god, but this backstory just feels like the player is trying to tie the PC into the BBEG and create explanations for things I had no plans of discussing.

I‚Äôm scared to talk to the player about it as a LOT of the backstory revolves around it, and it‚Äôs been months since having it sent to me, but I‚Äôm getting more and more uncertain about how to implement the elements given to me and balance them with the elements I‚Äôve built up as a DM. Because the player‚Äôs explanation of the BBEG laid forth in the backstory just don‚Äôt match what I‚Äôve been building to. 

Thank you for reading and feel free to ask more question, I‚Äôm happy to answer!",Ok_Requirement_8206,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/DMAcademy/comments/13k562i/how_do_i_properly_incorporate_or_adapt_to_an/,adapt,0.49482256174087524

Old players and new players.

While both of camps are VASTLY different, they are both characteristically easy to heal.

A crossbow here, a beam there, and voila! Uber push. It may not always work, and we may not always win, but both of these teams are BEAUTIFUL machines that work as advertised.
Nice co-workers.

But there exists a third team type that makes playing medic QUITE a bit harder. Experimental weirdos.

It's not meant to be derogatory, it's simply how they present themselves.

They have pretty decent mechanics I can get behind, but virtually ALWAYS make the wrong decisions.

They seem to be in that learning phase where they use nonsensical loadouts, nonsensical positioning, are severely tunnel visioned, spread far apart, and can't kill a sentry to save their life.

When I uber the noob pyro or the expert pyro, they USE THEIR FLAMETHROWER. And that's great, I can understand that.

But when I Uber the experimal medium Pyro, he insists on only using the clearly ""skilled"" and better weapon in his arsenal. The flare gun. And only hits a singular flare shot during the duration of the Uber. After that he runs at them with the Axtinguiser. And then... dies horribly. It's a little frustrating. 

I seldom spite these players. I mean, it's casual.

However, it brings me GREAT pain when a majority of these players are on my team. Weird decision making that gets them killed. badly scuffing me Ubers, being the only beings on the planet that are actually HARD to hit with my crossbow, and leaving me to die even if they can barely keep themselves alive.

So I ask.

How can I become stronger? 

How do I aid these broken, beaten down individuals?

He absolutely must go to the gym at specific times on specific days 5 days per week. It's a 2-2.5 hour workout each day, plus 30 min for driving, plus 30 min for his second shower each day, so it's like an extra 3-3.5 hours each time. He'll turn down plans with friends if it conflicts with his workout schedule, and he'll push aside any other conflicting responsibilities because it's his #1 priority in life, and I'm getting fed up with it. I've thought the amount of time he spends at the gym is a lot, but I've never been super into the gym and don't really know if it's all that much. He says it's really not that much time at the gym. We both work a lot, and I find myself having to pick up a lot of the slack around the house and taking care of chores, errands, and responsibilities because he just doesn't have the time in the day. I find myself hardly sleeping, and I can never find the time to work out myself because I just feel so overwhelmed with everything I have to take care of outside of work. If I need him to take care of something a certain day and it conflicts with his gym schedule, it's always a hard ""no"". If I ask him to do take care of things a lot of the time, he just won't have time to do it between work and the gym. If I ask him to not go a day because I need his help, he makes me feel extremely guilty because he frames it as me not caring about his health, because going to the gym is ultimately for his health and well-being, and he says he'll be more well-rested and more able to help me out if he goes to the gym. But I've been growing increasingly more resentful, and I really feel that the gym is more of a hobby for him and more for the goal of building his body (he mostly does weightlifting, not cardio) and he just uses health as an excuse to make me feel guilty for being a bad wife who doesn't care about his health. He's constantly telling me I'm crazy for getting on his case about the gym and says that it's ridiculous that I'm asking for him to deprioritize his health.

I don't know if I'm an asshole thinking that he shouldn't spend so much time at the gym and making it his #1 priority over other responsibilities, because I know that health is a priority. But I also don't know if there's a reasonable balance I should be asking him to strike here.",Temporary-Working-84,488,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13n4rvt/aita_for_telling_my_husband_to_skip_gym_days_or/,reduce,0.4197343587875366

9585,2023-05-19 19:44:58-05:00,TNOmod,TNO really reduces the horror of Nazism for sake of Gameplay.,"TNO really underestimates just how efficient the Nazis were at killing people for sake of Gameplay. Likely they would be still far from fully populating eastern Europe with Germans, but I can safely say several ethnicities such as Poles, Belarussians and Lithuanians would have been practically extinct if they kept the same rate they were going in 41-44 until 1962, considering how fanatic they were I don't see how that can be stopped.

[Just take a look at what they planned!](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalplan_Ost)

Just the hunger plan would have depopulated major cities like Kiev within the first few years. With Russia completely destroyed and unable to give any help, the Partisans would have been reduced to occasional bandit raids by 1962, Eastern Europe would be a nightmarish neo-feudal wasteland with German industrial cities and large farm proprieties to exploit the resources while the SS would kidnap and ""Aryanize"" millions of children who are blonde enough or have blue eyes. The Lebensborn program would have led to atrocities such as mass rapes and forced marriages for sake of populating the east, and that's not even counting slavery.

Bormann, Himmler and Herbert Backe (a name which people really should consider more among the monsters of the Reich) envisioned the remaining Slavic peoples as human cattle, used for working projects or an even worse version of old Russian serfs, most being made illiterate with ideological education and dying early as they will have access to little Healthcare and no vaccination at all. The East would be a biological bomb unseen since the Black Death with a malnourished people with low immunity and a heavy workload. 

""But partisans and economical costs would prevent them from fully enacting the plan"" you say. But that is assuming there is even a minimum of pragmatism or economic concern in the German logic. In our world, they killed close to 15 million people WHILE fighting the most powerful armies and economies on earth, being pushed back mile by mile, with the Soviets pumping support to well-developed partisan networks, with around 80% of their apparatus tied down on the Frontlines... and yet they managed to kill a million people IN A SINGLE CAMP between 1942 and 1944. That is not including the ongoing plans of mass starvation that would have killed close to the double of those who already died in our reality. They were literally gassing people while Germany was being invaded in 1945, you really think these scum are going to stop out of ""economic concerns""?

The fact Poland, Ukraine, Russia and the Baltics can still rebel and overthrow the Germans, especially in the case of Poland, is pure gameplay at this point. Truth is that if the Germans, in just 4 years, were able to genocide between 11 and 15 million people DESPITE being in a Total War, invaded and bombed from all sides, then there is no way they would have just stopped that. 

""But the resistance"", you say. Resistance movements were glorified after the war, but as I mentioned before, the Germans had most of their resources tied down elsewhere. And yet, within months, Heydrich was able to practically wipe out the Czech resistance in 1942. Even with a beaten army on the retreat, the Germans were able to raze Warsaw and turned the Polish Home Army into ashes in 1944. And Tito? He was lucky the Italians were completely inept and he could retreat to the Italian occupation zone when the German strikes almost could wipe him out, he gave away the location of other resistance movements like the Serbian Nationalists to distract the Germans. 

The French Resistance couldn't even stop the Nazis while they were on the retreat from destroying Paris, they were lucky the German governor had a minimum of a consciousness in not turning the city into another Warsaw. De Gaulle worked hard to whitewash the country to make it seem like the French all resisted but the truth is that he was alone in 1940, he couldn't even take Dakkar back then and the only colony which took him in was Equatorial Africa. I won't say all of France collaborated either, but let's not pretend the French resistance would have survived if the Germans won in the East.

Ukraine is the only one I see having some sort of rising, and even then they would have been crippled by Generalplan Ost. Partisans would have been little more than bandits in 1962. Maybe the terrain would help in the Caucasus but that's really it.

And since the Civil War will be removed (thank you devs), the one thing which would have given the resistance a shot will be gone with it. A simple power struggle/shadow war won't stop the Nazis when keeping a grip on the east is one of the few things they all agree with.

Am I being too bleak? I don't know, this is merely an observation from what I know about the Third Reich (Thank you Richard Evans for your amazing book trilogy), simply put, the worst case scenario already happened at game start. There is very little that can provide some sort of relief to the peoples of Eastern Europe other than a nuclear war.",A_devout_monarchist,122,https://www.reddit.com/r/TNOmod/comments/13md4kl/tno_really_reduces_the_horror_of_nazism_for_sake/,reduce,0.486590713262558

WotC explained that they removed Warlock's unique feature to allow them to cast more spells (as they put it, ""15 instead of 4"" at max level - why they completely ignored the existence of Short Rests in that calculation is beyond me).

The problem is... since their intended amount of Short Rests (as explained in the DMG) per day is 2, and Warlock also had a feature that allowed them to take a Short Rest in 1 minute, that brings their amount of intended Short Rests per day to 3, which results in starting the day with 4 spell slots after a long rest and then regaining 4 spell slots thrice per day.

As you can see, Warlock actually had 16 spellslots at max level, and now that number has actually been slightly reduced. So not only did they remove the uniqueness of Pact Magic, but they also didn't achieve what they intended. (Or, perhaps, they simply made up a BS excuse to standardify Warlock, which is further suggested by them comparing the new 15 slots to the old... ""4"", instead of at least 12, without using Eldritch Master. It's hard for me to give them the benefit of a doubt.)

Yes, you can argue that not many people actually take 2 Short Rests per day, but a much better way to fix that issue is making Short Rests more accessible by, for example, reducing them to 10 minutes on standard rules (which fits nicely with the whole ""10 minute Dungeon Turn"" concept; *Catnap* can then be turned into 1 minute or completely reworked/removed).

Turning Warlock into yet another half-caster is a terrible choice, period.

EDIT: As u/Tigeri102 pointed out in the comments, the nerf is even harsher when you consider the fact that all of those 16 spell slots were 5th level, compared to the 1st-5th level standard composition of slots. Mystic Arcanum still exists, but has been turned into an optional Invocation to allow more flexibility, which seems understandable... until you consider the fact that Warlock originally had Mystic Arcanum + 8 Invocations and in D&amp;Done they have 9 Invocations, of which 4 have to be Mystic Arcanum for it to be comparable to the 5e version. So it's either less spells or less Invocations.

TL;DR: 5e Warlock had 16 spellslots because of the intended 2 Short Rests and the Eldritch Master feature, in D&amp;Done they've got 15.",Falikosek,405,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/1324nya/wotc_actually_reduced_the_amount_of_spell_slots_a/,reduce,0.49552685022354126

I‚Äôve got a few thoughts‚Ä¶

1. Bring back home economics in a meaningful way so that people know how to grocery shop for food that isn‚Äôt processed (avoid the aisles)‚Ä¶and how to cook economically with that unprocessed food. Discuss healthy food habits, nutrition, as well as the financial/health cost of things like soda and sugary or processed ‚Äúsnacks‚Äù.

2. Personal finance classes which educate on debt, credit, how social security works, retirement ages, student loans, with a couple of personal finance books as required reading. Maybe some info on employment rights, what is inflation and what does it mean if your pay increases don‚Äôt keep up with inflation, etc.

3. What if the school day could be extended? We‚Äôre not an agrarian workforce anymore‚Ä¶nobody needs the summer off. Why not year round school with longer school day (8-5?) and have a couple more weeklong vacations added in for a short break? You‚Äôd save working families a ton on childcare, people coming out of school would have the equivalent of an extra 2-3 years of education.

4. Provide free, nutritional food in school so that each kid is getting their food needs met for breakfast and lunch at a minimum. Hard to learn when you‚Äôre hungry.

5. It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve taken health‚Ä¶but I don‚Äôt remember them talking about the cost of raising children. That should probably be part of the curriculum if it isn‚Äôt.

6. For kids intending on going to college, a class (or mandatory online information session) that explains various things related to paying for college (student loans, state vs private, community college credit transfers to state school, living at home vs paying room and board, etc.)

Thoughts on the above or any other ideas?

Edit: Adding insurance and taxes to the list of Personal Finance topics people think should be part of a basic public school education.

Also, maybe a mentorship program in HS that puts interested students in touch with members of the community who want to be a resource for students as they get ready to finish up public school?

Edit 2: Maybe set the bar high early on and get our kindergartners able to do something like this:

I‚Äôm texting my date and next thing I know I get sucker punched in the mouth. 

He then comes back up to me and gets all up close to me and asks ‚Äúwere you taking a picture of me?‚Äù And I said no I wasn‚Äôt I don‚Äôt know you or give a fuck about you..

Instructions for assignments are ambiguous, marking is ridiculous, and lectures are useless af (DO NOT ATTEND). I enrolled in Bcom hoping to do exams related to maths or anything that is just right/wrong, and now I have to deal with this horrendous subject where all of the assignments are writing which are marked completely subjectively! As a high achiever, my aim prior to the semester was to have extremely high WAM, but now with this stupid subject with its stupid marking scheme, I'm done. I just dont get it why they had to give such low scores for assignment 1. FYI, I put a lot of effort into writing the essay, not like I did not put any time into doing it.

What is there about sustainable commerce that makes it a compulsory course anyway? Can't believe I MUST pay $6k to learn a course in which lectures don't matter and the knowledge is purely common sense. Before getting to Unimelb, I already know that society and the environment are important, what more to learn? I would rather spend my $6k learning subjects that actually have knowledge rather than just common sense.

I believe the subject is mostly virtue signalling, just people trying to show how wonderful they are by caring about society or environment without any action being done. If you care so much about the environment and society, why aren't you out there leading businesses and changing their policies to solve those wicked problems. Instead, you are here giving students nearly-failed scores which drag their hardworking WAM down terribly. I suggest the professors only consume products that have no negative environmental impacts (THERE ARENT ANY) to save the world.

If the subject coordinators want students to be more interested in this stupid subject to save the environment and whatever, perhaps the grading should be more reasonable at least.

Now the majority of people playing it have wasted time and resources to a mid-league nerf that wasn‚Äôt even due to a bug or unintended mechanics, on a skill that isn‚Äôt even that good.","For context, twisters could be triggered 30.303 times per second, this isn‚Äôt anything new, but with Triggerbots it gets doubled. When applying poison stacks and curse on hit, this quickly put a huge burden on the servers.

GGG hotfixed this by adding a 100ms cooldown to the skill, effectively giving it 67% less damage. Now the only way to make the skill even somewhat playable is to run ungodly amounts of CDR, realistically getting us to 15 casts per second, a 50% nerf after more investment into gearing.

The biggest problem with this change is that it forces the skill onto Saboteur only because of needing Triggerbots and the 30% CDR nodes. This completely bricks all other build ascendancy choices we‚Äôve used in the past, namely Inquisitor (which was given a Build of the Week video recently) Assassin, and Chieftain, but a quick search on PoE Ninja suggests 7 other ascendancies were playing this skill and probably can no longer justify it.

I know that this isn‚Äôt a very popular build, but it‚Äôs been my favorite since ultimatum, and this sets a precedent that GGG can make a mistake and then dumpster your build mid-league because they‚Äôre too lazy to solve their problem with a balanced approach that keeps the skill playable.

10207,2023-05-11 10:11:08-05:00,TrueUnpopularOpinion,"Bombings like Dresden, Tokyo, Hiroshima, and Nagasaki were both necessary in ending WWII and justified as they drastically reduced the amount of Allied causalities that would have been sustained otherwise","World War Two was a war of strategic bombings. It was just the nature of that war. To expect the Allies to not use that strategy is to willing throw hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of more lives away fighting the Axis powers.

There's a lot of people, on and off reddit, that argue these were unnecessary warcrimes, that Allied generals should've been hung for ordering them, and in some extreme cases that they are equal to Axis actions in the same timeframe. When pressed on what could've been done differently their argument is only ever ""not bomb the people bombing you"". They also willfully ignore the military significance of these targets, whether it be the factories producing arms, rail yards being used to transport men and material, military headquarters in said cities, or harbor in said cities acting as bases for naval forces of the respective nations.

Even the idea of ""denying the german industry workers"", a justification sometimes thrown around for places like Dresden, is logical. German industry was very good at repairing itself with many bombed factories being returned to production of war materials within days if not hours. If you can't destroy the factory your next best option is to deny it the people who produce the goods. People, especially skilled laborers, are a hell of a lot harder to replace than factory structures and the (1940's era) machinery used in said production.

I'm sure there are people that disagree with my points that will so this so to you I ask: what honestly should've been done instead? Precision guided munitions weren't really a thing at this point in time outside of a few relatively ineffective wonderwaffens. The people killed, tanks and planes prevented from being produced, and fuel burned all saved Allied lives. World War One proved this. 

Disclaimer: there may already be a post about this up but I don't know that there is. Either way I feel it's an important conversation and most people in the ""Allied warcrimes"" camp have no realistic alternatives to strategic bombings.",screen-lt,207,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/13eq68m/bombings_like_dresden_tokyo_hiroshima_and/,sustainable,0.450852632522583

10347,2023-04-23 16:35:39-05:00,Genshin_Lore,The Sustainer Sacrificed Herself to Stop Forbidden Knowledge from Spreading," When the cataclysm hit 500 years ago, a huge wave of dark monsters along with forbidden knowledge were released from the abyss. The cataclysm was massive enough to take the lives of almost 3 archons. If the impact was so huge that the seven Archons and the Sustainer of Heavenly Principles were sent to deal with it, then wouldn't it be possible for the Sustainer to be corrupted as a consequence?

The theory I wanted to make is that the Sustainer is corrupted by Forbidden Knowledge. Now this could be a crack theory but let's go on as there are some hints in the opening cutscene.

We did see the Sustainer 500 years ago when the Cataclysm took place, so it's not far-fetched to assume that Celestia may have sent her to take care of the Forbidden Knowledge and the Abyss along with all the archons. It is possible that she was either corrupted or tried to absorb the Forbidden Knowledge herself and got corrupted as a result.

(If we go further and assume that the Sustainer is the Shade of Eonothem/Void then it would make sense why she would try to absorb it because she is absorbing it into a void but this is just speculation and can be ignored)

The Sustainer of Heavenly Principles should be on the side of, well, Heavenly Principles(aka Celestia). Then based on what we know and what colours mihoyo uses to portray the divine, her powers should be either blue like the sky nails or golden/yellow. But instead, she uses red cubes. This is strange because red is almost always depicted as corruption(of Forbidden Knowledge) in the game. Although abyssal power is purple, corruption by the forbidden knowledge is depicted by red.

# Uses of colour Red

**1)Durin's eyes and Dvalin's tears**

In the story quest where Venti talks about Dvalin, there is a scene that shows Dvalin facing Durin and Durin's eyes are red in that cutscene and based on what we know, Durin seemed to corrupted. Later, Dvalin who got corrupted by Durin's blood, shed/dropped a corrupted crystal tear at the beginning of the game which was once again red in colour. I suspect that they were corrupted by Forbidden Knowledge.

**2) Corrupted Akasha System**

In the Sumeru archon quest, we see an Eremite who used a Divine Capsule corrupted by Forbidden Knowledge and his Akasha system turned red to depict corruption.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**3)Withering**

Not much to explain here, the Withering is caused due to Forbidden Knowledge and is red in colour.

**4) Irminsul, Red Cubes and the Sky**

This part is important to note. When the Traveller first encounters the Irminsul, the sky is dyed red along with the Sustainer's cubes. And we know the reason is that the Irminsul was infected with Forbidden Knowledge. A lot of us speculated that the Sustainer may be somewhat responsible for it but the sky later clears up when the forbidden knowledge has finally gone. We see the sky return to normal when we return to that place in Sumeru's Interlude quest. This may prove that the cubes and the red sky are also related to Forbidden Knowledge and not only the Sustainer. This is the one detail that makes me believe she is corrupted and it is not just a colour scheme.

**5) Eleazar**

Eleazar is the result of forbidden knowledge released by Deshret. In the cutscene where the forbidden knowledge is removed from the Irminsul, there is a scene of Dunyazard's Eleazar being cured. When the scales on her hand vanish, they turn red before disappearing.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't remember more instances of the colour being used but now that we've somewhat established the uses of the colour red, let's review the opening cutscene where the Sustainer and the siblings clashed with each other and take a proper look at the powers she uses.

&amp;#x200B;

**1)The Sustainer's Hand**

Her left hand, unlike her right hand, looks like it's ""corrupted"" by some power. In the video, it actually moves around a bit and it looks like a glitch. (What if she's absorbing the forbidden knowledge in herself to stop Teyvat from getting destroyed?)

**2)The Stars behind her**

There are two ""stars"" she summons when standing behind her, one is golden but the other looks like it's getting stained by red. The corruption may have only partially consumed her at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qr658z8rcpva1.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5f8670248e813f6d06bce83192d9943ac3c1f625

**3)The Cubes**

When she chases the siblings with the cubes, there are brief moments where her cubes are golden/yellow before turning dark red. If you continue watching, the end of the huge line of cubes chasing them look slightly golden too.

&amp;#x200B;

**4)Sibling Trapped in the Cube.**

Because our Traveller has shown to be able to purify Dvalin's tears and has a strong resistance to forbidden knowledge, it is plausible that the sibling trapped in the cube pushed out the corruption and revealed the original colour or atleast a colour similar to the original colour of the Sustainer's cubes(golden) which made the Sustainer pause for a moment to stare at it.

# Sustainer's Hair, Eyes and Original Clothing

Now this is speculation about what I think the Sustainer originally was like.

The glow of an Archon's eyes and the ends of their hair(at least for the four we have right now) always matches the colour of their element and while Mihoyo doesn't have to strictly follow it, I believe the Sustainer's original power's colour matched the glow of her eyes. And her cape, though galaxy red now may have been golden before her corruption.

Adding on to all that, there is another line that may match well with this theory of the Sustainer getting corrupted. It is a line in the Traveller's profile in character details.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**The keeper is fading away**; the creator has not yet come.  
But the world shall burn no more for you shall ascend.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure if the Chinese version says Sustainer but either way, the word Keeper is a good substitute for Sustainer. They are quite interchangeable in the title ""Sustainer of Heavenly Principles"".

Perhaps the line meant that the Sustainer is fading/dying due to absorbing too much forbidden knowledge.",Lemonteaarts,72,https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Lore/comments/12wr30v/the_sustainer_sacrificed_herself_to_stop/,sustainable,0.41779688000679016

10396,2023-05-10 18:10:19-05:00,AmItheAsshole,AITA For Asking My Parents To Pay For My Vow Renewal If They Pay For My Sister‚Äôs Second Wedding?,"My (37F) sister (40F)  is having a second wedding this upcoming summer. Her first wedding was nearly 15 years ago as she married her college boyfriend when she was 25 and they divorced five years later. My sister didn‚Äôt talk at the time about why the marriage ended but came out as a lesbian a number of years later.  

She began dating her current partner five years ago. She is lovely and seems like a great match for my sister.  I am genuinely happy for them and wish them the best. But here is where the conflict comes in, as soon as my sister announced that she and her partner are  getting legally married our parents jumped on the opportunity to plan and pay for the wedding. My sister and her partner can more than easily pay for it but my parents insist on paying for it for ‚Äúthe principle of the matter‚Äù.  

I believe this insistence is largely a way for them to try to make up to my sister how they handled her sexuality in the past. My parents have become far more liberal in recent years but were heavily involved in the church when we were growing up. I didn‚Äôt know this at the time but my parents took my sister to some conversion therapy type program when she first tried to come out to them as a teenager. They now feel bad about this and try to make it up to her.

Despite this I think it is unfair that my sister is getting a second wedding paid for when I have only gotten one. I tried to bring this up to my parents by asking if they would pay for my husband and I‚Äôs vow renewal to make it even. They got mad at me and said I was being ridiculous and selfish at a time that should be about my sister.

10566,2023-05-07 12:31:35-05:00,DestinyTheGame,Sunday Plz - Buff Renewal Grasps!,"Greetings Guardians!

Ever since the conception of this sub, we've dealt with floods of reposts. We‚Äôre sure you‚Äôre familiar with them. Many are for important issues that are shared by the entire player base, while others are just for personal requests and desires for the game. The [Bungie Plz](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/wiki/bungieplz) was shortly implemented after conception as a central ""wish-list"" for all that we, the community, desired. It is *completely* user driven. With rare exceptions, nearly all submissions are sent in by you, the users of this subreddit!

However, just like Destiny 2, our wiki article began to experience problems as it grew over time. It's been getting just a few sizes too big. We understand that the continued addition of topics has begun to encroach on your ability to continue the conversation towards matters that mean the most to you, and even though [the Bungie Plz has seen so many successes over the years, **with well over 100 officially implemented game suggestions and desires**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/wiki/bungieplz#wiki_completed_in_destiny_2.21), there's still dozens upon dozens of retired topics that haven't seen the light of day for many months...even years!

---

Every Sunday, this thread will focus on a certain retired Bungie Plz topic **of your choosing, voted by the users.** We will curate a list of 5 suggestions to help focus your voting process, **but you get the final say** on what is talked about each week. By all means, if one topic is overwhelmingly desired despite not being part of those 5 items we picked, then we'll be happy to go with that one. Our curated list is only to help you focus the conversation. The only stipulation is that the topic must be new every week. This thread is for the entirety of the Bungie Plz wiki, so no back-to-back voting!

Think of these threads as a way to keep the spark alive, and to bring old topics up to fresh light. For example, do we still want to move Queenbreaker to the special slot? Or does Arbalest serve that purpose well enough now? Do we still want an all-black shader, or do we want to bring back Prismatic Matrix?

You tell us! This is your conversation, guardians.

For this week, you voted on:

# Buff Renewal Grasps

For next week, here are some suggestions:

* Reissue Season of Dawn weapons 
* Let us apply shaders to exotic weapons
* Please improve the Postmaster 
* Sell Exotic ornaments through Xur

Sound off in the sticky comment for which one sounds good, or [anything else in the Bungie Plz wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/wiki/bungieplz) that catches your eye, and we'll do our best to accommodate!

10575,2023-04-24 07:19:34-05:00,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my students that my contract wasn‚Äôt renewed.,"1. This is a throwaway for privacy reasons
2. I do not live in an English speaking country

I (23F) had a longterm sub position at a school in my city parallel to my master studies (I am studying so be a teacher). I had 4 classes since the beginning of the school year. 

My contract ends in two and a half weeks and then there will be 5 more weeks until summer holidays. 
Prior to the Easter vacation admin told me I was definitely staying and getting a renewed contract until summer holidays. 

Well last week it turned out it won‚Äôt be renewed because of reasons (like there is no  actual reason). 

I am sad about it and I told my students that I would no longer be there and when my contract will end exactly so they can plan ahead. 

I actually am on good terms with all 4 classes but 2 of them seem to like me really really really much. 
When I told them they said it‚Äôs not fair and that they want to keep me. 
I said ‚ÄûI also want to keep you but it‚Äôs not my decision but I am happy to have met you.‚Äú

Well a few kids decided to make it their decision and told their parents. A good handful of students and parents went to admin and told them what they thought about this ‚Äûnot-renewing‚Äú my contract. 

I received a bitter mail from admin that it was unprofessional to tell the students and was told from a teacher that is close to admin, that it‚Äôs as an AH move of me.

10629,2023-04-23 21:28:47-05:00,AutismInWomen,An autistic man at my school has ruined all advocacy for autistic kids at my school,"TW: Sexual harassment and assault, bullying, ableism, racism against black people 

Before all of this happened, lots of kids were in tune to autistic issues and supporting of us with IEPs or were in support classes, especially against teachers or faculty that treated any kid bad for their accommodations. Anyone who bullied one of the autistic support kids was immediately torn down and dumped by everyone. Obviously there will always be bullies but the pandemic brought a lot of the kids in my school together to support each other. That was until ‚ÄòKevin‚Äô (fake name) came along. 

Kevin is a 20 year old and this is his 3rd year as a senior. We had a class together early covid. He had some boundary issues about being told no, but other than that, he was really nice kid. He was really friendly and talked about his Pok√©mon special interest a lot which we never discouraged because it was better than acknowledging that half the class was online and we were all 6 feet apart from each other. He was not in autistic support, but he did have a teacher with him most times helping him with his work. 

This year he came in completely changed. 

One day at the beginning of this year, he lied to one of the football players in our grade saying he was in autistic support and didn‚Äôt have a chromebook but needed one to do a project (he didn‚Äôt have a project) the kid told him yes only if he sat at his study hall table and worked on it there with him.  Kevin instead took the open chromebook and ran off with it. Kevin proceeded to use the kid‚Äôs school account to look up porn and watch in the school bathroom, finish inside the chromebook, leave it dirty with his jizz and give it back like nothing happened. Kevin was 20, the kid was 17. 

The kid of course freaks out, and a study hall of 4 people + 1 teacher + 1 underpaid janitor were traumatized at the sight of the chrome book. This being high school, kids went wild. Secretly gave him the nickname ‚Äòthe bathroom beater‚Äô, but all hell broke loose when it was announced that they would not be punishing Kevin. Kids were outraged that someone could get away with that when a black mentally ill girl was arrested and expelled for having a panic attack and pushing teachers off of her when they held her down because she tried to go to the guidance office without permission the previous year (a whole other story) the Football kid was traumatized and Kevin got to come back like it was nothing. 

Then it came out that this wasn‚Äôt the first time he had gotten off in the bathroom; he had done this so often that he had his chromebook taken away.  Kids began to publicly call him the bathroom beater to his face and make fun of him. Kevin started to attempt to fight these kids, or if you were black, call you the n-word. 

He did get one punishment; he could go to the bathroom if a teacher went with him. Which is only a punishment to our overworked teachers who have to stop class to either grab a male teacher or go listen to this kid this kid pee. Except Kevin didn‚Äôt care anymore, and would continue beating on, where a disgusted teacher would to grab an overworked security guard to drag him out of there. 

Like I said, he didn‚Äôt care anymore.  He would go into a crowded bathroom to get off. He even exposed himself in class to get off. 

This has been going  on this whole year. Everyone is tired of tiptoeing around him trying to not get flashed because if you tell him to stop he tries to hurt you. He has never been punished once but if you raise an issue with it you get a detention or 3 day suspension for harassment.

The board won‚Äôt do anything about it because they haven‚Äôt seen it themselves. Supposedly, his single mom is autistic and an ex special education kid. She is very open about seeing nothing wrong with how he acts and let‚Äôs him do it openly at home. She refuses to enroll him in an alternative school. His support needs do not qualify him for the autistic support class, and he bullies those kids until they meltdown. 

Now it‚Äôs the end of the year and most parents want autistic kids and alllistics completely separated no matter the support needs. Allistics now see us as wild animals that need to be controlled. Open ableism is okay.  

I know Kevin needs help. I know every adult failed him. But he is a grown man and we already fear being shot at school, I shouldn‚Äôt have to be scared of my sibling being assaulted by him. I know the ableism isn‚Äôt his fault, but I‚Äôm still bitter.

**TL;DR: how do I stand up to my dermatologist and finally get on accutane after nearly 4 years of failed acne treatments?** 

I've had acne for about 10 years and persistent hormonal acne for about 5 (I am F midtwenties). First time I saw a derm (about 4 years ago) I was nearly cleared up in 6 months with topicals (tret, clindamycin) and orals (minocycline). However, this only lasted for about 6-12 months. I wasn't flaring too badly and had moved states so my new PCP just decided to manage by topical prescriptions (mistake, lol). Over the course of a year the acne continued to get worse. Last fall I started grad school and got a new derm. We tried dapsone, azelaic acid, sulfa wash, and spiro. I am currently on spiro 100mg + tret and clindamycin. I am not having a good time. Hormonal acne on jaw is persistent, spiro is making me dizzy a lot, and I am icing my face and taking advil for inflammatory pain. I feel like I am living appointment to appointment. When my derm first put me on spiro I asked ""what if it doesn't work"" and she mentioned other topicals, oral antibiotics (unwilling to try again, they messed me up), going up on spiro (BP dropping to 100/60 on some days, not willing to increase dose), and my face lit up when she said accutane. She went on about how although it's an ""acne miracle drug"" it is dangerous, it's ""hard to get someone approved"" (I do not have any mental health concerns), and ""requires lots of appointments.""

Y'all, I'm fed up. My skin is flaring up and I am in pain. Next appt is in a few weeks. Classmate who had similar acne to mine (moderately severe but extremely persistent) is telling me to advocate for myself and ask for accutane as I have already tried so many things over the course of 4 years (and this is the best timing for me in terms of my grad school program).

I am scared to stand up to my derm as she already basically shut me down once (and I know her next step is to increase the spiro). I appreciate her conservative approach but enough is enough. How do I plead my case? Pls help thank you",manicmanicotta,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accutane/comments/1333mju/help_with_selfadvocacy_and_standing_up_to_your/,advocacy,0.4095222055912018

10727,2023-04-11 20:54:33-05:00,LeftWingMaleAdvocates,Why I joined the Men‚Äôs‚Äô Advocacy Movement: the greatest weapon the misandrists have is division,"I‚Äòve recently been looking into these sorts of  mens‚Äô advocacy spaces and it is one of the strangest positive experiences I‚Äôve had. As someone on the left, I feel for the longest time I had internalised a lot of the gaslighting coming from feminist sources. Literally everyone I respected both online or real life were making these sorts of feminist arguments: ‚ÄúOh if you‚Äôre insulted by the word ‚Äòincel‚Äô that‚Äôs a you problem,‚Äù ‚Äúsexual harassment against men isn‚Äôt a serious issue‚Äù, ‚Äúmen are inherently violent and aggressive‚Äù, ‚Äúmasculinity is toxic and the world would be better if women ruled it‚Äù.   


These things always bothered me, but I held them down and repressed them, because I blamed myself: surely I must be being unreasonable. It‚Äôs all my fault. I‚Äòm not entitled to my own emotions and I have to control them.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I found this subreddit. I heard how many men were facing the exact same issues that I was, and I felt genuine empathy for all of them. Then it hit me: wait, why do I feel sorrow and empathy for other people while blaming myself for the exact same issues that I‚Äôm also feeling? The weight of my own problems was added on to the problems everyone else was happening at it totally shifted my perspective.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, whenever people on the left made these misandrist comments and I politely told them that they could be offensive, you know what their response was? Variations upon ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre being unreasonable‚Äù, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all your fault‚Äù, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not entitled to your own emotions‚Äù 

&amp;#x200B;

This was the final realisation for me. To hear these people put my own subconscious thoughts into actual words told me exactly what was happening. I left all of them, anyone with even the slightest hint of misandry was expelled from my feed. Ironically this meant that I had to remove almost all social media from my life but this isn‚Äôt a bad thing.   


Now whenever I see mens‚Äô issues taken seriously, it‚Äôs immensely cathartic. I never realised just how internalised this all was until the feminists so very helpfully put all these repressed feelings and thoughts into words. I won‚Äôt pretend these insults no longer hurt, but at least I finally have given myself permission to even deserve to feel them at all.",knightfluttershy,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates/comments/12j5wt9/why_i_joined_the_mens_advocacy_movement_the/,advocacy,0.47623756527900696

10951,2023-05-14 17:30:23-05:00,BanPitBulls,"Pit ""advocates"" are a pitbull's worst friend &amp; best enemy.","I feel sorry for pits, I really do. I have compassion for them. Human beings bred them to be the way they are. In the same way that my Hound was bred to hunt, we created a dog with not only the capacity to maim &amp; kill but the gameness that compels them to fight to the death. I feel sorry for the pits that are condemned to a shelter for their entire life, spending 23.5 hours a day in a cage. I feel sorry for the pits that are shopped around home after home by ""do-good"" shelters, regardless of the fact that they clearly don't do well in that environment. I feel sorry for the pits that go their entire lives with good behavior &amp; then suddenly snap because of the behaviors that were bred into them.

Pit ""advocates"" seem to think they're advocating for this breed they claim to love by posting pictures of them wearing pajamas &amp; harassing anyone that is vocal about being hurt by one. They're not. Advocating for them would be acknowledging that, regardless of whether not their happy hippo or w/e they call them has exhibited aggressive behavior, more protection should be in place regarding breed standards.

It should bother them that there's no regulation on breeding &amp; that there's been no attempt to breed aggression out of them. Maybe their pit is fine with dogs, fine with kids, has never shown aggression once in it's life. It should bother them that there are many pits that have killed/maimed. Maybe their pit is sweet as a button &amp; just ""misunderstood."" It should bother them that this breed they ""love"" so much is frequently in the news after attacks. A few months ago, a pit that was banned from my dog park was in the news after attacking a dog on the street &amp; tearing out it's spine. That should bother them. They should want better.

One thing I will say is I agree with pit owners that say ""there are no bad dogs, just bad owners."" Pits are doing exactly what they were bred to do! The biggest problem, dare I say, is not the pits themselves. They didn't breed themselves. The true problem is the ridiculous, delusional, pretentious pit ""advocates"" that claim to love &amp; stand by the breed but don't seem to care enough to do anything to improve it. They don't care about breed regulations, they don't care about the fact that many pits sit in shelters because they're too aggressive for a home, &amp; they don't care if a pit mauls another dog, another person, or a child until it's their own.

So any pit ""advocate"" out there, you're right. There are only bad owners. &amp; if you are posting silly pajama pics &amp; insisting ""Well, my hippo would never!"" whenever there's an attack instead of saying ""My pit might be the exception to the rule but I see that there's a problem with this breed that I love &amp; I'd like to discuss ways to make it better"" then you are part of the problem. If you are not advocating to make a better &amp; mentally healthier breed, which would help pits as a whole have a better life, then you are part of the problem. If you love pits but are complacent whenever there's an attack &amp; blame the one attacked for ""provoking"" it, you are not advocating for a better breed. You're not helping anyone. You are the bad owner.",mydogislife_,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/BanPitBulls/comments/13hph9l/pit_advocates_are_a_pitbulls_worst_friend_best/,advocates,0.46540674567222595

&gt; This is the typical Democrat/left-wing propaganda of casting white people and white majority movements as immoral, and anything opposed to the authoritarian impositions of the left as ""hate"".

&gt; yes, people should be free to create racial restrictions on who can enter their store.

Racist protests that he is not a racist:

&gt; Opposing left-wing authoritarianism that tries to impose an anti-racist belief system on people's private actions doesn't make someone a racist.

&gt;  All members of the sanctimonious Leftist Cult avoid debate and endorse authoritarianism to force private citizens to adopt their beliefs.

&gt; This is the modern left: equates freedom of association and speech with support for the worst things that people utilize that free association and speech for.

&gt; It's an utterly neurotic mindset that gravitates towards authoritarianism: lockdowns, centralized (regulatory) control over industry and private association, and censorship.

This ‚Äúmoderator‚Äù repeatedly confuses public civil rights &amp; private refusal of violent authoritarian tyranny, with authoritarian tyranny, censorship, etc.

This ‚Äúmoderator‚Äù clearly is ignorant of the [Reddit User Agreement](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement-april-18-2023), which makes clear that the contract between him and Reddit, Inc. is a private agreement ‚Äî and the [Reddit Content Policy](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045715951) which the User Agreement requires him to abide by, which states:

### Rule 1: Remember the human. Reddit is a place for creating community and belonging, not for attacking marginalized or vulnerable groups of people. Everyone has a right to use Reddit free of harassment, bullying, and threats of violence. Communities and people that incite violence or that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.

### Marginalized or vulnerable groups include, but are not limited to, groups based on their actual and perceived race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, immigration status, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, pregnancy, or disability. These include victims of a major violent event and their families. 

### While the rule on hate protects such groups, it does not protect those who promote attacks of hate or who try to hide their hate in bad faith claims of discrimination.

11023,2023-05-16 21:38:07-05:00,NYguns,‚ÄúHow Gun Control Advocates and Media Are Making Things Worse‚Äù,"(I originally wrote this in April 2021, but I firmly believe it bears repeating)

This morning, I heard two [deceptive] ‚Äúfacts‚Äù on the ‚Äúnews.‚Äù  Some 40,000 people are killed a year in what was termed as ‚Äúgun violence‚Äù and there have been 54 ‚Äúmass shootings‚Äù so far this MONTH.   Perhaps, a better way to state what was heard was that it was propaganda, being spread by the mass media.  This propaganda being spread by gun control groups and the media is making matters worse, when it comes to violence with firearms.   

Is there gun violence in the US? Of course there is. Is any innocent life taken or any injury to an innocent person horrific and a tragedy? Absolutely.  Do we, as a nation need solutions to the problems? Again, of course we do.  However, the alleged ‚Äúfacts‚Äù [actually propaganda] being pushed by people like David Hogg, Michael Bloomberg, former Rep Gabrielle Giffords and her husband Senator Mark Kelly are at best distorting the truth. More likely, the propaganda they are spreading  will cause harm and make matters worse.  

The numbers the gun control crowd throw around (and the same numbers the media repeat without question) do not tell the full story.   When the gun control crowd and the media say there have been 54 mass shootings this MONTH, they paint a picture for the general public of 54 ‚ÄúColumbines‚Äù or 54 events like we just saw in Indianapolis.  The public would be surprised to learn that the ‚Äú54‚Äù includes gang drive-by‚Äôs where multiple people are wounded.  This number includes a felon in a stand-off with police in his home, where the felon wounded a couple police officers and was then killed by officers returning fire.  The number includes a parent who killed their family and then themselves (a family annihilator).  In fact, the number includes any situation where a gun is fired and three or more persons are wounded, including the shooter. This however is NOT the definition used by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) definition is ‚Äúa multitude homicide incident in which four or more victims are murdered with firearms -not including the offenders- within one event...in public locations... not attributable to any other underlying criminal activity.‚Äù   By using the CRS definition, there have been about 8 mass shooting incidents per year between 2017-2020 and 3 this year.  Although even one event is abhorrent, there CERTAINLY a were NOT 54 THIS MONTH!  

The other big number thrown around is 40,000 people killed in gun violence.  HOWEVER, according to the FBI‚Äôs Uniform Crime Reporting Program database homicide data for the last fully reported year (2019),  there were 10,258 homicides with firearms, down from a five year period high of 11,014 in 2017.  Why the huge disparity?  The gun control groups (and media who are repeating these numbers) are including every accidental firearm discharge as well as suicides and LAWFUL firearm usage- or in other words, self defense and lawful use of force.  

Why does it matter what numbers are used? For gun control groups, the use of these numbers is intended to portray to the public a much larger problem than what actually exists to push through their agenda.  The gun control groups are not technically lying, but they are spinning deceptive numbers to try to convince the public - through inference at minimum- that their proposed solutions are the ones that should be implemented.   They want to ban so-called ‚Äúassault rifles,‚Äù despite the fact that true assault rifles are almost NEVER used in a crime (finding the exact date an assault rifle - one capable of bursts of fully automatic fire at minimum- was used in a crime is difficult.  Homicides with ANY type of rifle accounted for 364 homicides in 2019.   On average over the last five years, there have been 315 homicides a year with ALL rifles.  An ‚Äúassault weapons ban‚Äù would have a negligible effect on homicide, since over the last five years, rifles accounted for less than 2.2% of homicides   

Further, by lumping suicide, accidents and homicides together, the gun control groups and media distract from the REAL problems and REAL solutions that may found, in favor of the illusions of expanded background checks, weapon bans, etc.   Suicide is a mental health issue- NOT a firearm issue.   Japan has an incredibly high suicide rate, despite banning firearms since the 1970‚Äôs.  They CLEARLY prove that a person does not need a gun to commit suicide, AND prove that a person who definitely wants to commit suicide WILL find a way - even without a gun.   Therefore the solution is in mental health, not in gun control.  

Gang violence will also not be solved by any type of weapons ban or increased background checks.  Criminal gangs get their firearms by theft, and background checks do not stop theft.  Gang problems occur because of drugs and poverty, and no gun control proposal addresses those issues.   

Firearms deaths from accidents are very often preventable.  Firearms Safety Education goes a very long way to helping reduce accidents.   Instead of banning guns, we should be teaching how to handle them safely.  

There are real solutions to violence- regardless of the weapon used.  But those solutions will NEVER be found with gun control groups and the media spreading propaganda that distracts from the real problems.    We NEED mental health care reform in this country.   We NEED to better address the poverty and other issues that drive gangs and drugs.  We NEED Firearms Safety Education- like the classes the NRA has been providing for decades and decades.   But as long as we allow the media and gun control groups to keep push propaganda for the sake of an agenda, people will needlessly die, because the public has been distracted from the real problems and real solutions.",Dominus_Max,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYguns/comments/13joyv8/how_gun_control_advocates_and_media_are_making/,advocates,0.4043165445327759

The logic of anti 2nd amendment advocates is an enigma. There's no doubt they are coming for your rights. See post for explanation and link.,"Regarding Dred Scott decision, the Senator states, ""That was the (Supreme) Court interfering with the authority of Congress to legislate on what was the majority‚Äôs point of view to start pushing back on slavery. And in the Bruen decision, which was where the New York legislature was attempting to protect its citizens from the violence of rampant gun violence, the Supreme Court said they didn‚Äôt have the authority to do that. And that is completely divorced from what the majority of Americans want about¬†gun¬†control.‚Äù

1. He compared a controversial and racist decision that was overturned by the 13th and 14th amendment with a constitutional right listed in the Bill of Rights.
2. He implies that gun ownership protected by the 2nd amendment is equal to slavery.
3. He sees the Supreme Court decision on Bruen as taking away their (Governments) ""authority"" rather than upholding the constitutional rights of all citizens.

Especially on social media, reddit including, you can go to any left wing socialist spaces and find little to no information regarding policy proposals, current events (outside of outrage mongering), or discussion of theory. It's all progressive activism and reactionary tantrums with zero substance. I just fail to see the connecting line between an industry co-opted by capitalist billionaires around a community of historically disenfranchised people now sitting in a position of highest privilege culturally is at all relevant to left wing ideology, or in any way conducive to the betterment of people's lives.

I can understand the historical context of LGBT activism aligning with left wing ideals as a means of fighting the evangelical right of the 20th century, but nowadays it really seems like nobody gives a shit about poor working class people completely left out to dry. In fact, a majority of the time, I see self proclaimed leftists actively scorning the uneducated, working class labor force in America especially, usually while browsing twitter as they work their 25 hour week from a cushy stay-at-home coding job.

Enough of my personal opinions though, can you explain where the disconnect comes from? I doubt it needs to be said, but I don't have anything against these communities or, more specifically, individuals belonging to these communities. It just seems like a big waste of time and a way for those in power to keep us distracted from affecting actual change for the betterment of the people without. What are we fighting for, exactly?

The only right way to keep native plants is to get your native seed from a reliable academic source in your exact area, but most people reading this constant native plant activism will just order the seeds online and slowly wreak havoc on the genetic diversity of plant species and thereby their survival in the wild. 

Half of the people on this subreddit are actually anti-lawn activists trying to persuade people to get rid of their lawns with all these stupid native plant suggestions.

The pro-male groups and advocates mention many issues, but it looks like there's not much activism for male rape victims, male domestic violence victims, homeless men, fighting against the male-only draft, fighting against circumcision.

I often times hear as explanation that there's no resources to fight for men because society just doesn't care about men, or that society won't listen to any problems men articulate and if, feminists would crush any activism for men's issues. But it doesnt make sense. Not only because the entire political scene is dominated by interest groups mostly made up of men (you could argue here ""that's not men, that's interest groups mostly made up of men""), but also because there are a lot of explicitly pro-male groups and advocates that (1) do have many resources and (2) have no problems with expressing massive criticism against feminism. Examples for this are the whole Republican Party, a lot of political pundits like Jordan Peterson or Steven Crowder, and the whole rest of the manosphere (MRA, Redpillers, etc.).

* (1) Enough resources to gain attention for something they want to talk about. The Republicans are a major force, pundits like Peterson and Crowder have millions of followers, they're not a small fringe group.
* (2) No fear to attack feminism. Republicans had no fear of advancing policies that feminists hate, like abortion bans, and pro-male pundits have no fear of calling feminists evil names and accusing feminism of the most vicious things. 

So they have the resources to gain attention and no fear to attack feminism. Why then is there a lack of activism in the things mentioned above? Why does Peterson not make activism for male domestic violence victims a crucial part of his work? Why do Republicans not work on plans to fight against homelessness? Why do MRA not start a hashtag #BelieveMen to help male rape victims come forward? Why do all the men's groups not work together and organize walk-outs in high schools and colleges to protest against the male-only draft (""Men are not meat-grinders"")? How to explain the lack of this activism? Again: These groups and individuals have all the resources and are not afraid to attack feminism. So where is the activism? I think the most likely explanation is: They have different preferences. **It's not that ""Society doesn't care about men"", it's that ""The men's issues that get the most attention are different from the men's issues that are often times mentioned in MRA circles.**"" This is can be either good or bad. As an example for bad preferences, look at Egypt, a country with massive problems like corruption, media censorship, poor economic performance, environmental issues, etc., yet there is a massive focus on [attacking gays](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-64390817) [and atheists](https://timep.org/2021/12/29/atheists-in-egypt-life-on-the-edge-of-civil-death/). Of course, these are horrific preferences, but still, it's not like ""Egyptians don't care about Egypt"", they just have bad preferences. The same way, the preferences that male advocates have may be good or bad. But one thing can't be denied: That they care about men.

So what do they care about most of the time? I see two dominant issues: **(1) The so-called ""attack on masculinity"" and (2) everything related to the outcomes in dating, sex and relationships**. There is an immense amount of critics of the term ""toxic masculinity"", from Fox News to Jordan Peterson to Warren Farrell to Rollo Tomassi to the Centre for Male Psychology, etc., combined with calls to ""more positive representations of masculinity."" And there is an immense amount of grievances about the divorce laws (alimony, custody), child support laws, the involuntary celibate men, the fact that men supposedly have to put so much more effort in dating, and of course false accusations of sexual harassment or rape. Not only are these the things that most male advocates focus on, they seem to get the most listeners. Does anyone think Peterson would have gotten millions of fans if he would have focused on male victims of domestic violence instead of telling men that it's okay to be masculine, to reject efforts to make men weak and instead embrace strength and stocism (just like he [always remains calm and rational](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymauW6D890U))? Of course not. 

What do you think about this? Why do most pro-male advocates who have enough resources and rhetoric power seem to have different preferences for their pro-male activism than most of the issues mentioned by MRA?",Kimba93,59,https://www.reddit.com/r/FeMRADebates/comments/131m9nw/promale_advocates_lack_of_activism_or_different/,activism,0.4977738857269287

11204,2023-03-08 18:17:40-06:00,TrueUnpopularOpinion,"Respectability politics (""love is love"" ""we are just like you"") won LGBTQ+ people our rights, not radical activism.","And we owe same-sex marriage to the voters who cast their ballots at the ballot boxes, not to Stonewall and to radical activism.

There has been so much revisionist history in the last 8 years since Obergefell v. Hodges, and I don't understand why considering that we all lived through this era and should remember which methods worked and which did not to get us our rights, so I don't know why people are acting like they didn't.

The number of times I have heard ""you have your rights because of radical activists and drag queens, you owe them everything!"" but that is revisionist history and it does not stand up to scrutiny. They love to say Marsha P. Johnson threw the first brick at Stonewall.

Frankly, I don't care who threw the first brick. I recognize Stonewall as one of several contributing factors to the start of an LGBTQ+ political movement, but let's step back for a second.

What rights did we win because of Stonewall? What legislation was passed directly because of Stonewall which lead to an increase in our rights? Is it not true that, in fact, after Stonewall the police began to crack down even more on LGBTQ+ establishments and society temporarily regressed in its understanding of our community's activism, because they began to stereotype us as not only deviant but violent? Any time someone tells me that Stonewall is the be all, end all of LGBTQ+ activism, I ask them, what was its direct, immediate impact?

What won us the right to marry and gradual societal tolerance and, in some cases, acceptance was the message that ""We are just like you, we cannot control who we love or how we feel about our gender identities, we want the right to be contributing members of society with equal rights. We want to get married. I want to be able to visit my husband in the hospital when he is sick. We want the right to raise children and adopt and experience the joys of parenthood. We deserve the right to donate blood, so that if our family members need life-saving blood transfusions, we can volunteer as a donor. We want to live our lives in peace, not to force anything on anyone.""

It was a message of respectability politics. It was a message that no, we are not a threat. No, we are not trying to overturn the cornerstones of society. It was an integrationist message. And it WORKED.

Now, we are deviating from that message. We are now pushing a message that we need to, in fact, overturn all of society and that not doing so is ""oppression."" We are pushing the message that there is no boundary which should not be pushed. We are pushing messages of being perpetually the ""other"" on the outside of society, a segregationist message, while simultaneously pushing things into the public square that society is not on board with.

8 years ago, I would have been in disbelief if I knew where we would be today in terms of the types of things we advocate for today. We need to understand as well, that we will never be able to win a war on whether or not kink should be displayed in the public square, and other culture war issues. We will never win these wars, because parents' biological human instincts are to protect their children, and the second they perceive a threat they will rip the curtain back and our rights will be gone. Any rights given by the government can just as easily be taken away.

It's time to wake up, stop teaching revisionist history, and get back to our central message which worked.",123amcdbx,111,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/11md3gy/respectability_politics_love_is_love_we_are_just/,activism,0.4304509460926056

But from now on I will bring the evidences to the light of of certain communities and opposition constantly incitening and threatening the Eritrean Tigrinya community in the name of anti Eritrean government activism,"From threats of genocide (Ruwanda genocide) and civil war against Eritrean Tigrinyas by various armed Eritrean opposition parties and officials to racial incitements and targeted propaganda also by social media influencer and troll farms with ties  To RSADO Eritrean Islamic Jihad DMLEK AL NAHDA that we Tigrinyas are Kaffir Agazianist Unionist Tigray Tigrinya alliance landgrabber settlers and responsible of all problems in Eritrea.

Eritrean Tigrinyas are settlers and landgrabbers because of 1990s land reform and nationalization where especially Tigrinyas lost their land.

Eritrean tigrinyas who live because of national service in lowlands are settlers but the Eritrean low landers who migrated to Asmara in the last 100 years own property businesses homes lands religious buildings are allowed live in asmara rightfully but when Tigrinyas live in the low lands they are setttlers

Also what the influencer have said against Eritrean Tigrinyas I will make it transperent.

This will have long time consequences and will destroy the unity within the Eritrean opposition how deep their activism is rooted in inciting against one tribe the Tigrinyas in the name of anti Eritrean government activism",The-Truth12,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eritrea2/comments/133huh1/i_have_waited_till_both_holy_celebrations_and/,activism,0.4370584785938263
