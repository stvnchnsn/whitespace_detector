      "I was a huge light-weight when I used to drink. I had a birthday party a couple years ago where I got proper schwasted. Don‚Äôt remember any of it. Anyway, a really good friend of mine committed suicide a few months later. The last time I ever saw her was at my party, and I don‚Äôt remember it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Gave up drinking after that.\n",
      "Yeah, I think drinking alcohol is fine (in moderation), and I enjoy lots of alcoholic drinks, and occasionally even the feeling of being drunk. That said, not consuming it is pretty much objectively healthier than drinking it all other things being equal. If you're happy without it I see very little reason to start (or go back to) drinking it.\n",
      "I agree with you although it's hard to ignore the fact that drinking a little can be a nice way to unwind. I stopped drinking a year ago due to being pregnant and still barely drink as I'm breastfeeding. At this point I don't really miss it although my husband and I do have a glass of wine every so often which is nice.\n",
      "I started on my zero alcohol journey today, im interested to see what happens myself\n",
      "I haven‚Äôt drank alcohol in 5 years and don‚Äôt miss it at all. Coffee in the morning and water the rest of the day. Feel great all the time.\n",
      "Yeah buddy ! I was an , ahem, what I guess you could call a \"problem\" drinker (if by problem you mean fun) .  But I quite 10 years ago and never looked backed.  Life did get significantly better in all ways.\n",
      "Never had a problem with any of those things you listed but that could be because I very seldom have more than two drinks in a given day and I rarely have more than 3 in a given week.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you remember your nights out more and had frequent hangovers I'd say you were probably more of a problem drinker than you'd admit to.\n",
      "I just got back from a 5 day trip to Vegas completely sober.  In bed before midnight every night and up by 8:00 for coffee and breakfast with money in my pocket because I didn't blow it all gambling th night before.  It was amazing.  No hangovers and  got to enjoy all my time there. Even rented a car so I could enjoy a trip out to the desert without any fear of getting DUI.\n",
      "Sounds like maybe you do have a problem with alcohol since all your points seem to be based on drinking considerable amounts of alcohol (e.g. more than a couple of pints).\n",
      "\n",
      "A glass of red wine with a meal for example is not going to give you any of the above problems and may even have a small anti-oxidant benefit.\n",
      "Good for you.  Seriously.  Even for those of us who try to taper, but need a full stop, then can graduate back into social drinking, it's never easy.  It's as stressful as anything.  I'd suspect that leads us to drink further to the \"IDGAF\" phase.\n",
      "\n",
      "What's critical is to find that happiness.  If you dip back into the fluid, you'll deal with having to set a ton of boundaries which may not work.\n",

      "üíØ. Quitting alcohol is the best thing I ever did.\n",
      "I really want to quit altogether (at least for a while to observe the effects) but I love taste of beer (and sometimes wine) so much. I pretty much substituted 80% of my beer consumption with n/a beer but sometimes it doesn't cut it bc I don't have too many n/a beers available where I live. N/a wine is not an option (expensive, not readily available). Anyways I left out about 90% of alcohol amount of my previous years (used to drink gallons of beer and get drunk all the time) but still want to try and cut it altogether\n",
      "This honestly shouldn't be unpopular. I do drink every once in awhile, but I see nothing wrong in not drinking\n",
      "I only drink when I know I'm not going to be driving for the rest of the day, which means I almost always do my drinking at home. Plus I assume I'm saving money by buying alcohol from the store instead of individual drinks at a bar. So a 1 and 4 aren't really an issue for me. I drink often but I never get drunk to the point of memory loss, and no matter how drunk I've gotten it's never changed my thought process to the point where I would do things I would never do normally. Basically a lot of these things aren't an issue for me, but if they are for someone else then maybe ditching alcohol is exactly what they need. I'm definitely not here to say alcohol isn't at all bad for you, but a lot of these problems you've listed are fixed by just drinking responsibly.\n",
      "Same can be said about many addictions like smoking and drugs. I was a smoker for 8 years, then I quit in this January. In time, I have regained what I have thought I never had before. I think other addictions have similar effects when u quit too. The thing is, though, it's easier to become addicted than quitting them. That's the sad part. People who had either will for not to be addicted to any or never addicted to anything, they are really lucky.\n",
      "Alcohol is supposed to be an occasional thing, though.  So many people drink it several times a week, even a day, when it really should only be consumed a few times a month.  It‚Äôs not meant to be bought and consumed like a Pepsi.\n",
      "I don‚Äôt drink bc im powerless over alcohol and my life becomes unmanageable\n",
      "I fucking love drinking man\n",
      "The only ones of these benefits that apply to me are 1, 3, and maybe 4? (Saving money is always a plus I guess, but I don‚Äôt mind paying a little extra to have a bit more fun)\n",
      "\n",
      "I‚Äôm not sure 2 is true at all. Yeah, I‚Äôm aware alcoholic beverages are technically bad for your health, but soft drinks are also really bad for your health, and I‚Äôve never heard of them being LESS bad than alcohol. I would think they‚Äôre worse if anything, or at the very least on the same level. But hey, I‚Äôm not a nutritionist; maybe you know something I don‚Äôt. \n",
      "\n",
      "I‚Äôm always conscious of mixing different alcohols and I drink pretty moderately, so I only ever get super mild hangovers if I get one at all. \n",
      "\n",
      "I only ever drink enough to get buzzed, not blackout drunk or anything, so memory is never an issue. \n",
      "\n",
      "I don‚Äôt agree that all inhibitions exist for a reason or that you can necessarily ‚Äúchoose to loosen them.‚Äù I feel like a lot of my inhibitions are A) irrational and B) involuntary, and getting a little bit buzzed helps with that. \n",
      "\n",
      "I‚Äôm someone who just doesn‚Äôt seem to get addicted to alcohol. I never get cravings for it and I never get withdrawal symptoms. The only time I ever want it is to make social situations easier and more fun. \n",
      "\n",
      "I don‚Äôt drink heavily enough for things to ever ‚Äúget out of hand.‚Äù\n",
      "\n",
      "There can definitely be good reasons to quit alcohol if it‚Äôs a problem for you, but I also believe there are people who are entirely capable of doing it responsibly. \n",
      "\n",
      "And yeah, even if you‚Äôre like me and don‚Äôt have serious problems with alcohol, going sober IS technically the healthier option. Alcohol is literally just poison; it‚Äôs better not to put it in your body at all. But honestly, life isn‚Äôt a video game where you‚Äôre trying to min-max every little thing. It‚Äôs valid to sacrifice a little health for the sake of pleasure sometimes. Just don‚Äôt overdo it. Most of you probably aren‚Äôt getting 8 hours of sleep a night, completely avoiding all junk food and processed sugars, and exercising daily either.\n",
      "Sounds more like you either had a drinking problem or extremely low tolerance. Most of what you wrote could also be solved by having less alcohol.\n",
      "As with everything else it‚Äôs all about moderation. \n",
      "\n",

      "You drink while partying once a month/a couple of times a year? Go for it my dude. Hangovers suck, but you‚Äôve got to live a little.\n",

      "I fully respect people that can have a fun night out without alcohol, but my personal opinion is that it‚Äôs boring as fuck. Most people need a little help to gain the courage to hit the dance floor‚Ä¶\n",
      "How else am I supposed to get motivation to build this Pyramid?\n",
      "I‚Äôm impressed by the amount of people that refuse to hear anything negative about alcohol.\n",
      "I agree. I haven't had a drink in over a year and don't miss it at all. I didn't quit, but I just haven't had the urge for the minor enjoyment, followed by the major consequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "It causes cancer. People who are otherwise healthy -- sometimes very healthy -- can't wrap their heads around that.\n",
      "I lost my wife to cancer,  then my boss to cancer, and was in an auto accident shortly afterwards that took a man‚Äôs life,  not my fault, but the trauma combined turned my consistently fun relationship with booze to a dependency and caused me to loose complete control of who I was as a person.   Never did I think I could be an alcoholic but the conditions were perfect for alcohol to take control.  I used to think all life would be bland without alcohol but the reality is booze takes away all the fun and tricks you into harming yourself with a FORCED change in attitude (getting and feeling drunk). \n",

After or during most outdoor activities, there is drinking. Alcohol is pretty ingrained in our society and you can really feel its absence. Hell, one of my last dates the woman asked me if my sobriety was court ordered--i wanted to scream. Most people I've interacted with can't imagine anyone choosing to be sober because they feel life is better with it. It can be exhausting dealing with that all the time.\n",

      "I like drinking some nights to help me relax and stop my thoughts. Some days I get stressed at work or I cooked a meal for family and i'm worried about the taste so I have a drink or two just to calm my nerves and get rid of the feelings I had. It doesn't happen often and I never go on nights out but some days it just feels nice to have my mind impaired.\n",

I have nothing against people drinking, I just wish people would acknowledge its not harmless and if you are ok with the risks, more power to you.

I can always drive if needed\\n2. Soft drinks are cheaper and normally healthier.\\n3. Weight is easier to manage.\\n4. Going out costs less. Not only the cost in drinks, but also taxis\\n5. I forgot how a hangover feels\\n6. My skin is better\\n7. I remember nights out more\\n8. Inhibitions exist for a reason. I can control if I choose to loosen them\\n9. The peace of mind that comes from not regularly introducing an addictive substance into your body. \\n10. Zero chance of things getting out of hand and me waking up with regrets. \\n\\nThose are 10 benefits I've found from quitting. I had to narrow them down as I can think of many more, but 10s a nice round number. I'm really struggling to find a single benefit to be found by reintroducing alcohol to my life. \\n\\nSobriety has many benefits. Consuming even modest amounts of alcohol doesn't appear to have any.\\n\\n\\nEdit: there seems to be a lot of comments talking about how it's only binge drinking that's negative and that drinking in moderation is fine, which is an ok opinion. \\n\\nI'm just still unclear what advantages moderate drinking has over being teetotal?\",\n",

I had to narrow them down as I can think of many more, but 10s a nice round number. I&amp;#39;m really struggling to find a single benefit to be found by reintroducing alcohol to my life. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Sobriety has many benefits. Consuming even modest amounts of alcohol doesn&amp;#39;t appear to have any.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: there seems to be a lot of comments talking about how it&amp;#39;s only binge drinking that&amp;#39;s negative and that drinking in moderation is fine, which is an ok opinion. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just still unclear what advantages moderate drinking has over being teetotal?&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",
